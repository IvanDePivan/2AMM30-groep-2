This repository contains all the files needed to replicate the results for the assignment, both component 1 and 2.

## Replicating our training
To run the code used for fine-tuning the models:
- Open the `Flairmodel.ipynb` in Colab
- Upload the `data` folder to your Colab workspace
- Run the cells under `Prerequisites`
- Run either the `Component 1` or `Component 2` cells

Intermediate files are also included in the `data` folder, allowing for running of some cells out of order.
