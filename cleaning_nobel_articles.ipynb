       "['Alfred Bernhard Nobel ( , ; 21 October 1833\\xa0– 10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist. He is known for creating dynamite as well as having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize, though he also made several important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel\\'s most famous invention was dynamite, an explosive using nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867. Nobel displayed an early aptitude for science and learning, particularly in chemistry and languages; he became fluent in six languages and filed his first patent at the age of 24. He embarked on many business ventures with his family, most notably owning the company Bofors, which was an iron and steel producer that he had developed into a major manufacturer of cannons and other armaments. Nobel was later inspired to donate his fortune to the Nobel Prize institution, which would annually recognize those who \"conferred the greatest benefit to humankind\". The synthetic element nobelium was named after him, and his name and legacy also survives in companies such as Dynamit Nobel and AkzoNobel, which descend from mergers with companies he founded. Nobel was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which, pursuant to his will, would be responsible for choosing the Nobel laureates in physics and in chemistry. Personal life. Early life and education. Alfred Nobel was born in Stockholm, United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway on 21 October 1833. He was the third son of Immanuel Nobel (1801–1872), an inventor and engineer, and Karolina Andriette Nobel (née Ahlsell 1805–1889). The couple married in 1827 and had eight children. The family was impoverished and only Alfred and his three brothers survived beyond childhood. Through his father, Alfred Nobel was a descendant of the Swedish scientist Olaus Rudbeck (1630–1702), and in his turn, the boy was interested in engineering, particularly explosives, learning the basic principles from his father at a young age. Alfred Nobel\\'s interest in technology was inherited from his father, an alumnus of Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.Following various business failures, Nobel\\'s father moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, and grew successful there as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives. He invented the veneer lathe (which made possible the production of modern plywood) and started work on the torpedo. In 1842, the family joined him in the city. Now prosperous, his parents were able to send Nobel to private tutors and the boy excelled in his studies, particularly in chemistry and languages, achieving fluency in English, French, German and Russian. For 18 months, from 1841 to 1842, Nobel went to the only school he ever attended as a child, in Stockholm. Nobel gained proficiency in Swedish, French, Russian, English, German, and Italian. He also developed sufficient literary skill to write poetry in English. His \"Nemesis\" is a prose tragedy in four acts about the Italian noblewoman Beatrice Cenci. It was printed while he was dying, but the entire stock was destroyed immediately after his death except for three copies, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. It was published in Sweden in 2003 and has been translated into Slovenian, French, Italian, and Spanish. Religion. Nobel was Lutheran and regularly attended the Church of Sweden Abroad during his Paris years, led by pastor Nathan Söderblom who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1930. He was an agnostic in youth and became an atheist later in life, though he still donated generously to the Church. Health and relationships. Nobel traveled for much of his business life, maintaining companies in Europe and America while keeping a home in Paris from 1873 to 1891. He remained a solitary character, given to periods of depression. He remained unmarried, although his biographers note that he had at least three loves, the first in Russia with a girl named Alexandra who rejected his proposal. In 1876, Austro-Bohemian Countess Bertha Kinsky became his secretary, but she left him after a brief stay to marry her previous lover Baron Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner. Her contact with Nobel was brief, yet she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and probably influenced his decision to include a peace prize in his will. She was awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace prize \"for her sincere peace activities\". Nobel\\'s longest-lasting relationship was with Sofija Hess from Celje who he met in 1876 in Baden near Vienna, where she worked as an employee in a flower shop. The liaison lasted for 18 years. Residences. In the years of 1865 to 1873, Alfred Nobel had his home in Krümmel, Hamburg, he afterward moved to a house in the Avenue Malakoff in Paris that same year. In 1894, when he acquired Bofors-Gullspång, the Björkborn Manor was included, he stayed at his manor house in Sweden during the summers. The manor house became his very last residence in Sweden and has after his death functioned as a museum. Alfred Nobel died on 10 December 1896, in Sanremo, Italy, at his very last residence, Villa Nobel, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. Scientific career. As a young man, Nobel studied with chemist Nikolai Zinin; then, in 1850, went to Paris to further the work. There he met Ascanio Sobrero, who had invented nitroglycerin three years before. Sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin because it was unpredictable, exploding when subjected to variable heat or pressure. But Nobel became interested in finding a way to control and use nitroglycerin as a commercially usable explosive; it had much more power than gunpowder. In 1851 at age 18, he went to the United States for one year to study, working for a short period under Swedish-American inventor John Ericsson, who designed the American Civil War ironclad, USS \"Monitor\". Nobel filed his first patent, an English patent for a gas meter, in 1857, while his first Swedish patent, which he received in 1863, was on \"ways to prepare gunpowder\".The family factory produced armaments for the Crimean War (1853–1856), but had difficulty switching back to regular domestic production when the fighting ended and they filed for bankruptcy. In 1859, Nobel\\'s father left his factory in the care of the second son, Ludvig Nobel (1831–1888), who greatly improved the business. Nobel and his parents returned to Sweden from Russia and Nobel devoted himself to the study of explosives, and especially to the safe manufacture and use of nitroglycerin. Nobel invented a detonator in 1863, and in 1865 designed the blasting cap. On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel\\'s younger brother Emil. Fazed by the accident, Nobel founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in Vinterviken so that he could continue to work in a more isolated area. Nobel invented dynamite in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally. In 1875, Nobel invented gelignite, more stable and powerful than dynamite, and in 1887, patented ballistite, a predecessor of cordite. Nobel was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1884, the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an honorary doctorate from Uppsala University in 1893. Nobel\\'s brothers Ludvig and Robert founded the oil company Branobel and became hugely rich in their own right. Nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions. It operated mainly in Baku, Azerbaijan, but also in Cheleken, Turkmenistan. During his life, Nobel was issued 355 patents internationally, and by his death, his business had established more than 90 armaments factories, despite his apparently pacifist character. Inventions. Nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like \"kieselguhr\" (diatomaceous earth) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as \"dynamite\". Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in Redhill, Surrey, England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance \"Nobel\\'s Safety Powder\", but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the Greek word for \"power\" . Nobel later combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to collodion, but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. Gelignite, or blasting gelatin, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances. Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds. It was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the \"Age of Engineering\", bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a cost to his health. An offshoot of this research resulted in Nobel\\'s invention of ballistite, the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant. Nobel Prize. There is a well known story about the origin of the Nobel Prize, although historians have been unable to verify it and some dismiss the story as a myth. In 1888, the death of his brother Ludvig supposedly caused several newspapers to publish obituaries of Alfred in error. One French newspaper condemned him for his invention of military explosives—in many versions of the story, dynamite is quoted, although this was mainly used for civilian applications—and this is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death. The obituary stated, \"\" (\"The merchant of death is dead\"), and went on to say, \"Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday.\" Nobel read the obituary and was appalled at the idea that he would be remembered in this way. His decision to posthumously donate the majority of his wealth to found the Nobel Prize has been credited to him wanting to leave behind a better legacy. However, it has been questioned whether or not the obituary in question actually existed. On 27 November 1895, at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the Nobel Prizes, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobel\\'s will allocated 94% of his total assets, 31,225,000 Swedish kronor, to establish the five Nobel Prizes. This converted to £1,687,837 (GBP) at the time. In 2012, the capital was worth around SEK 3.1\\xa0billion (US$472\\xa0million, EUR 337\\xa0million), which is almost twice the amount of the initial capital, taking inflation into account. The first three of these prizes are awarded for eminence in physical science, in chemistry and in medical science or physiology; the fourth is for literary work \"in an ideal direction\" and the fifth prize is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international fraternity, in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of peace congresses. The formulation for the literary prize being given for a work \"in an ideal direction\" (\\' in Swedish), is cryptic and has caused much confusion. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted \"ideal\" as \"idealistic\" and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less romantic authors, such as Henrik Ibsen and Leo Tolstoy. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, Dario Fo and José Saramago, who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism. There was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers, technicians or other inventors. Sweden\\'s central bank Sveriges Riksbank celebrated its 300th anniversary in 1968 by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a sixth prize in the field of economics in honor of Alfred Nobel. In 2001, Alfred Nobel\\'s great-great-nephew, Peter Nobel (born 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given \"in Alfred Nobel\\'s memory\" from the five other awards. This request added to the controversy over whether the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel is actually a legitimate \"Nobel Prize\". Death. Nobel was accused of high treason against France for selling Ballistite to Italy, so he moved from Paris to Sanremo, Italy, in 1891. On 10 December 1896, he suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed to where he could speak only his native tongue. Nobel was surrounded by his paid servants at the time of his death who didn\\'t speak his native tongue so he wrote, \"how sad it is to be without a friend who could whisper a consoling word and would one day gently close one\\'s eyes.\" He had left most of his wealth in trust, unbeknownst to his family, in order to fund the Nobel Prize awards. He is buried in Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm. Monuments and legacy. The \"Monument to Alfred Nobel\" \\\\( in Saint Petersburg is located along the Bolshaya Nevka River on Petrogradskaya Embankment. It was dedicated in 1991 to mark the 90th anniversary of the first Nobel Prize presentation. Diplomat Thomas Bertelman and Professor Arkady Melua were initiators of the creation of the monument (1989). Professor A. Melua has provided funds for the establishment of the monument (J.S.Co. \"Humanistica\", 1990–1991). The abstract metal sculpture was designed by local artists Sergey Alipov and Pavel Shevchenko, and appears to be an explosion or branches of a tree. Petrogradskaya Embankment is the street where Nobel\\'s family lived until 1859. Criticism of Nobel focuses on his leading role in weapons manufacturing and sales, and some question his motives in creating his prizes, suggesting they are intended to improve his reputation.',\n",
       " 'Economics is a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. Microeconomics analyzes what\\'s viewed as basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyzes the economy as a system where production, consumption, saving, and investment interact, and factors affecting it: employment of the resources of labour, capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public policies that have impact on these elements. Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing \"what is\", and normative economics, advocating \"what ought to be\"; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics. Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, including business, finance, cybersecurity, health care, engineering and government. It is also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, feminism, law, philosophy, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, and the environment. Definitions of economics over time. The earlier term for the discipline was \\'political economy\\', but since the late 19th century, it has commonly been called \\'economics\\'. The term is ultimately derived from Ancient Greek (\"oikonomia\") which is a term for the \"way (nomos) to run a household (oikos)\", or in other words the know-how of an (\"oikonomikos\"), or \"household or homestead manager\". Derived terms such as \"economy\" can therefore often mean \"frugal\" or \"thrifty\". By extension then, \"political economy\" was the way to manage a polis or state. There are a variety of modern definitions of economics; some reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists. Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1776) defined what was then called political economy as \"an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations\", in particular as: Jean-Baptiste Say (1803), distinguishing the subject matter from its public-policy uses, defined it as the science \"of\" production, distribution, and consumption of wealth. On the satirical side, Thomas Carlyle (1849) coined \"the dismal science\" as an epithet for classical economics, in this context, commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of Malthus (1798). John Stuart Mill (1844) delimited the subject matter further: Alfred Marshall provided a still widely cited definition in his textbook \"Principles of Economics\" (1890) that extended analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level: Lionel Robbins (1932) developed implications of what has been termed \"[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject\": Robbins described the definition as not \"classificatory\" in \"pick[ing] out certain \"kinds\" of behaviour\" but rather \"analytical\" in \"focus[ing] attention on a particular \"aspect\" of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity.\" He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the analysis of wealth: how wealth is created (production), distributed, and consumed; and how wealth can grow. But he said that economics can be used to study other things, such as war, that are outside its usual focus. This is because war has as the goal winning it (as a sought after end), generates both cost and benefits; and, resources (human life and other costs) are used to attain the goal. If the war is not winnable or if the expected costs outweigh the benefits, the deciding actors (assuming they are rational) may never go to war (a decision) but rather explore other alternatives. We cannot define economics as the science that studies wealth, war, crime, education, and any other field economic analysis can be applied to; but, as the science that studies a particular common aspect of each of those subjects (they all use scarce resources to attain a sought after end). Some subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets. From the 1960s, however, such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behaviour and rational-choice modelling expanded the domain of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields. There are other criticisms as well, such as in scarcity not accounting for the macroeconomics of high unemployment. Gary Becker, a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas, described the approach he favoured as \"combin[ing the] assumptions of maximizing behaviour, stable preferences, and market equilibrium, used relentlessly and unflinchingly.\" One commentary characterizes the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the \"choice process and the type of social interaction that [such] analysis involves.\" The same source reviews a range of definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subject-matter that the texts treat. Among economists more generally, it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving, or should evolve. Many economists including nobel prize winners James M. Buchanan and Ronald Coase reject the method-based definition of Robbins and continue to prefer definitions like those of Say, in terms of its subject matter. Ha-Joon Chang has for example argued that the definition of Robbins would make economics very peculiar because all other sciences define themselves in terms of the area of inquiry or object of inquiry rather than the methodology. In the biology department, they do not say that all biology should be studied with DNA analysis. People study living organisms in many different ways, so some people will do DNA analysis, others might do anatomy, and still others might build game theoretic models of animal behavior. But they are all called biology because they all study living organisms. According to Ha Joon Chang, this view that you can and should study the economy in only one way (for example by studying only rational choices), and going even one step further and basically redefining economics as a theory of everything, is very peculiar. History of economic thought. From antiquity through the physiocrats. Questions regarding distribution of resources are found throughout the writings of the Boeotian poet Hesiod and several economic historians have described Hesiod himself as the \"first economist\". However, the word Oikos, the Greek word from which the word economy derives, was used for issues regarding how to manage a household (which was understood to be the landowner, his family, and his slaves) rather than to refer to some normative societal system of distribution of resources, which is a much more recent phenomenon. Xenophon, the author of the Oeconomicus, is credited by philologues for being the source of the word economy. Other notable writers from Antiquity through to the Renaissance which wrote on include Aristotle, Chanakya (also known as Kautilya), Qin Shi Huang, Ibn Khaldun, and Thomas Aquinas. Joseph Schumpeter described 16th and 17th century scholastic writers, including Tomás de Mercado, Luis de Molina, and Juan de Lugo, as \"coming nearer than any other group to being the \\'founders\\' of scientific economics\" as to monetary, interest, and value theory within a natural-law perspective. Two groups, who later were called \"mercantilists\" and \"physiocrats\", more directly influenced the subsequent development of the subject. Both groups were associated with the rise of economic nationalism and modern capitalism in Europe. Mercantilism was an economic doctrine that flourished from the 16th to 18th century in a prolific pamphlet literature, whether of merchants or statesmen. It held that a nation\\'s wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver. The doctrine called for importing cheap raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods, which could be exported, and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies. Physiocrats, a group of 18th-century French thinkers and writers, developed the idea of the economy as a circular flow of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of \"laissez-faire\", which called for minimal government intervention in the economy. Adam Smith (1723–1790) was an early economic theorist. Smith was harshly critical of the mercantilists but described the physiocratic system \"with all its imperfections\" as \"perhaps the purest approximation to the truth that has yet been published\" on the subject. Classical political economy. The publication of Adam Smith\\'s \"The Wealth of Nations\" in 1776, has been described as \"the effective birth of economics as a separate discipline.\" The book identified land, labour, and capital as the three factors of production and the major contributors to a nation\\'s wealth, as distinct from the physiocratic idea that only agriculture was productive. Smith discusses potential benefits of specialization by division of labour, including increased labour productivity and gains from trade, whether between town and country or across countries. His \"theorem\" that \"the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market\" has been described as the \"core of a theory of the functions of firm and industry\" and a \"fundamental principle of economic organization.\" To Smith has also been ascribed \"the most important substantive proposition in all of economics\" and foundation of resource-allocation theory—that, under competition, resource owners (of labour, land, and capital) seek their most profitable uses, resulting in an equal rate of return for all uses in equilibrium (adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training and unemployment). In an argument that includes \"one of the most famous passages in all economics,\" Smith represents every individual as trying to employ any capital they might command for their own advantage, not that of the society, and for the sake of profit, which is necessary at some level for employing capital in domestic industry, and positively related to the value of produce. In this: The Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus (1798) used the concept of diminishing returns to explain low living standards. Human population, he argued, tended to increase geometrically, outstripping the production of food, which increased arithmetically. The force of a rapidly growing population against a limited amount of land meant diminishing returns to labour. The result, he claimed, was chronically low wages, which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level. Economist Julian Lincoln Simon has criticized Malthus\\'s conclusions. While Adam Smith emphasized production and income, David Ricardo (1817) focused on the distribution of income among landowners, workers, and capitalists. Ricardo saw an inherent conflict between landowners on the one hand and labour and capital on the other. He posited that the growth of population and capital, pressing against a fixed supply of land, pushes up rents and holds down wages and profits. Ricardo was also the first to state and prove the principle of comparative advantage, according to which each country should specialize in producing and exporting goods in that it has a lower \"relative\" cost of production, rather relying only on its own production. It has been termed a \"fundamental analytical explanation\" for gains from trade. Coming at the end of the classical tradition, John Stuart Mill (1848) parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system. Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the market\\'s two roles: allocation of resources and distribution of income. The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene. Value theory was important in classical theory. Smith wrote that the \"real price of every thing\\xa0... is the toil and trouble of acquiring it\". Smith maintained that, with rent and profit, other costs besides wages also enter the price of a commodity. Other classical economists presented variations on Smith, termed the \\'labour theory of value\\'. Classical economics focused on the tendency of any market economy to settle in a final stationary state made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size. Marxian economics. Marxist (later, Marxian) economics descends from classical economics and it derives from the work of Karl Marx. The first volume of Marx\\'s major work, \"Das Kapital\", was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and the theory of surplus value which, he believed, explained the exploitation of labour by capital. The labour theory of value held that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how the workers only got paid a proportion of the value their work had created. Marxian economics was further developed by Karl Kautsky (1854–1938)\\'s \"The Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx\" and \"The Class Struggle (Erfurt Program)\", Rudolf Hilferding\\'s (1877–1941) \"Finance Capital\", Vladimir Lenin (1870–1924)\\'s \"The Development of Capitalism in Russia\" and \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\", and Rosa Luxemburg (1871–1919)\\'s \"The Accumulation of Capital\". Neoclassical economics. At its inception as a social science, economics was defined and discussed at length as the study of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth by Jean-Baptiste Say in his \"Treatise on Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth\" (1803). These three items were considered only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution. Say\\'s definition has survived in part up to the present, modified by substituting the word \"wealth\" for \"goods and services\" meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, Lionel Robbins noticed that this definition no longer sufficed, because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his \"Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science\", he proposed a definition of economics as a study of human behaviour, subject to and constrained by scarcity, which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). According to Robbins: \"Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses\". Robbins\\' definition eventually became widely accepted by mainstream economists, and found its way into current textbooks. Although far from unanimous, most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins\\' definition, even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics, emanating from that definition. A body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term \"economics\" was popularized by such neoclassical economists as Alfred Marshall and Mary Paley Marshall as a concise synonym for \"economic science\" and a substitute for the earlier \"political economy\". This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences. Neoclassical economics systematized supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the labour theory of value inherited from classical economics in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side. In the 20th century, neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favour of ordinal utility, which hypothesizes merely behaviour-based relations across persons. In microeconomics, neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping decision making. An immediate example of this is the consumer theory of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded. In macroeconomics it is reflected in an early and lasting neoclassical synthesis with Keynesian macroeconomics. Neoclassical economics is occasionally referred as \"orthodox economics\" whether by its critics or sympathizers. Modern mainstream economics builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as econometrics, game theory, analysis of market failure and imperfect competition, and the neoclassical model of economic growth for analysing long-run variables affecting national income. Neoclassical economics studies the behaviour of individuals, households, and organizations (called economic actors, players, or agents), when they manage or use scarce resources, which have alternative uses, to achieve desired ends. Agents are assumed to act rationally, have multiple desirable ends in sight, limited resources to obtain these ends, a set of stable preferences, a definite overall guiding objective, and the capability of making a choice. There exists an economic problem, subject to study by economic science, when a decision (choice) is made by one or more players to attain the best possible outcome. Keynesian economics. Keynesian economics derives from John Maynard Keynes, in particular his book \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\" (1936), which ushered in contemporary macroeconomics as a distinct field. The book focused on determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible. Keynes attempted to explain in broad theoretical detail why high labour-market unemployment might not be self-correcting due to low \"effective demand\" and why even price flexibility and monetary policy might be unavailing. The term \"revolutionary\" has been applied to the book in its impact on economic analysis. Keynesian economics has two successors. Post-Keynesian economics also concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes. It is generally associated with the University of Cambridge and the work of Joan Robinson. New-Keynesian economics is also associated with developments in the Keynesian fashion. Within this group researchers tend to share with other economists the emphasis on models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour but with a narrower focus on standard Keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity. These are usually made to be endogenous features of the models, rather than simply assumed as in older Keynesian-style ones. Chicago school of economics. The Chicago School of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and monetarist ideas. According to Milton Friedman and monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if the money supply does not greatly expand or contract. Austrian School of economics. The Austrian School emphasizes human action, property rights and the freedom to contract and transact to have a thriving and successful economy. It also emphasizes that the state should play as small role as possible (if any role) in the regulation of economic activity between two transacting parties. A key component of Austrian economics is the principle of sound money. As Ludwig Von Mises, one of the most prominent 20th century Austrian economists, stated, \"Ideologically it (sound money) belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of rights.\" Austrian economists assert that sound money prevents government actors from debasing the currency, disrupting the savings rate of the population and artificially distorting the economic choices of individual actors. Other schools and approaches. Other wschools or trends of thought referring to a particular style of economics practised at and disseminated from well-defined groups of academicians that have become known worldwide, include the Freiburg School, the School of Lausanne, post-Keynesian economics and the Stockholm school. Contemporary mainstream economics is sometimes separated into the Saltwater approach of those universities along the Eastern and Western coasts of the US, and the Freshwater, or Chicago school approach. Within macroeconomics there is, in general order of their historical appearance in the literature; classical economics, neoclassical economics, Keynesian economics, the neoclassical synthesis, monetarism, new classical economics, New Keynesian economics and the new neoclassical synthesis. In general, alternative developments include ecological economics, constitutional economics, institutional economics, evolutionary economics, dependency theory, structuralist economics, world systems theory, econophysics, econodynamics, feminist economics and biophysical economics. Methodology. Theoretical research. Mainstream economic theory relies upon analytical economic models. When creating theories, the objective is to find assumptions which are at least as simple in information requirements, more precise in predictions, and more fruitful in generating additional research than prior theories. While neoclassical economic theory constitutes both the dominant or orthodox theoretical as well as methodological framework, economic theory can also take the form of other schools of thought such as in heterodox economic theories. In microeconomics, principal concepts include supply and demand, marginalism, rational choice theory, opportunity cost, budget constraints, utility, and the theory of the firm. Early macroeconomic models focused on modelling the relationships between aggregate variables, but as the relationships appeared to change over time macroeconomists, including new Keynesians, reformulated their models with microfoundations, in which microeconomic concepts play a major part. Sometimes an economic hypothesis is only \"qualitative\", not \"quantitative\". Expositions of economic reasoning often use two-dimensional graphs to illustrate theoretical relationships. At a higher level of generality, mathematical economics is the application of mathematical methods to represent theories and analyze problems in economics. Paul Samuelson\\'s treatise \"Foundations of Economic Analysis\" (1947) exemplifies the method, particularly as to maximizing behavioral relations of agents reaching equilibrium. The book focused on examining the class of statements called \"operationally meaningful theorems\" in economics, which are theorems that can conceivably be refuted by empirical data. Empirical research. Economic theories are frequently tested empirically, largely through the use of econometrics using economic data. The controlled experiments common to the physical sciences are difficult and uncommon in economics, and instead broad data is observationally studied; this type of testing is typically regarded as less rigorous than controlled experimentation, and the conclusions typically more tentative. However, the field of experimental economics is growing, and increasing use is being made of natural experiments. Statistical methods such as regression analysis are common. Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size, economic significance, and statistical significance (\"signal strength\") of the hypothesized relation and to adjust for noise from other variables. By such means, a hypothesis may gain acceptance, although in a probabilistic, rather than certain, sense. Acceptance is dependent upon the falsifiable hypothesis surviving tests. Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question, given different tests, data sets, and prior beliefs. Experimental economics has promoted the use of scientifically controlled experiments. This has reduced the long-noted distinction of economics from natural sciences because it allows direct tests of what were previously taken as axioms. In some cases these have found that the axioms are not entirely correct. In behavioural economics, psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 for his and Amos Tversky\\'s empirical discovery of several cognitive biases and heuristics. Similar empirical testing occurs in neuroeconomics. Another example is the assumption of narrowly selfish preferences versus a model that tests for selfish, altruistic, and cooperative preferences. These techniques have led some to argue that economics is a \"genuine science\". Microeconomics. Microeconomics examines how entities, forming a market structure, interact within a market to create a market system. These entities include private and public players with various classifications, typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and light government regulation. The item traded may be a tangible product such as apples or a service such as repair services, legal counsel, or entertainment. Various market structures exist. In perfectly competitive markets, no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product. In other words, every participant is a \"price taker\" as no participant influences the price of a product. In the real world, markets often experience imperfect competition. Forms of imperfect competition include monopoly (in which there is only one seller of a good), duopoly (in which there are only two sellers of a good), oligopoly (in which there are few sellers of a good), monopolistic competition (in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), monopsony (in which there is only one buyer of a good), and oligopsony (in which there are few buyers of a good). Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be \"price makers\", which means that they can influence the prices of their products. In partial equilibrium method of analysis, it is assumed that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets. This method aggregates (the sum of all activity) in only one market. General-equilibrium theory studies various markets and their behaviour. It aggregates (the sum of all activity) across \"all\" markets. This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium. Production, cost, and efficiency. In microeconomics, production is the conversion of inputs into outputs. It is an economic process that uses inputs to create a commodity or a service for exchange or direct use. Production is a flow and thus a rate of output per period of time. Distinctions include such production alternatives as for consumption (food, haircuts, etc.) vs. investment goods (new tractors, buildings, roads, etc.), public goods (national defence, smallpox vaccinations, etc.) or private goods (new computers, bananas, etc.), and \"guns\" vs \"butter\". Inputs used in the production process include such primary factors of production as labour services, capital (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and land (including natural resources). Other inputs may include intermediate goods used in production of final goods, such as the steel in a new car. Economic efficiency measures how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available technology. Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs. A widely accepted general standard is Pareto efficiency, which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off. The production–possibility frontier (PPF) is an expository figure for representing scarcity, cost, and efficiency. In the simplest case an economy can produce just two goods (say \"guns\" and \"butter\"). The PPF is a table or graph (as at the right) showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs, which limit feasible total output. Each point on the curve shows potential total output for the economy, which is the maximum feasible output of one good, given a feasible output quantity of the other good. Scarcity is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume \"beyond the PPF\" (such as at \"X\") and by the negative slope of the curve. If production of one good \"increases\" along the curve, production of the other good \"decreases\", an inverse relationship. This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good, decreasing the latter. The slope of the curve at a point on it gives the trade-off between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, an example of a \"real opportunity cost\". Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. \"Along the PPF\", scarcity implies that choosing \"more\" of one good in the aggregate entails doing with \"less\" of the other good. Still, in a market economy, movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents. By construction, each point on the curve shows \"productive efficiency\" in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point \"inside\" the curve (as at \"A\"), is feasible but represents \"production inefficiency\" (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of \"one or both goods\" could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high unemployment during a business-cycle recession or economic organization of a country that discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy allocative efficiency (also called Pareto efficiency) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points. Much applied economics in public policy is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved. Recognizing the reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organize society for the most efficient use of resources has been described as the \"essence of economics\", where the subject \"makes its unique contribution.\" Specialization. Specialization is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and empirical considerations. Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production, say from differences in stocks of human capital per worker or capital/labour ratios. According to theory, this may give a comparative advantage in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant, thus \"relatively\" cheaper, input. Even if one region has an absolute advantage as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output, it may still specialize in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else. It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs, including high-income countries. This has led to investigation of economies of scale and agglomeration to explain specialization in similar but differentiated product lines, to the overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions. The general theory of specialization applies to trade among individuals, farms, manufacturers, service providers, and economies. Among each of these production systems, there may be a corresponding \"division of labour\" with different work groups specializing, or correspondingly different types of capital equipment and differentiated land uses. An example that combines features above is a country that specializes in the production of high-tech knowledge products, as developed countries do, and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful, resulting in different in opportunity costs of production. More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own high-tech and low-tech products. Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market prices of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage, so that (relatively) low-cost inputs go to producing low-cost outputs. In the process, aggregate output may increase as a by-product or by design. Such specialization of production creates opportunities for gains from trade whereby resource owners benefit from trade in the sale of one type of output for other, more highly valued goods. A measure of gains from trade is the \"increased income levels\" that trade may facilitate. Supply and demand. Prices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy. The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In microeconomics, it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition, which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power. For a given market of a commodity, \"demand\" is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). Demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is \"constrained utility maximization\" (with income and wealth as the constraints on demand). Here, utility refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred. The law of demand states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things unchanged). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the substitution effect). In addition, purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy (the income effect). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply. \"Supply\" is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be \"profit maximizers\", meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged. That is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The \"Law of Supply\" states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply. Market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply. Firms. People frequently do not trade directly on markets. Instead, on the supply side, they may work in and produce through \"firms\". The most obvious kinds of firms are corporations, partnerships and trusts. According to Ronald Coase, people begin to organize their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market. Firms combine labour and capital, and can achieve far greater economies of scale (when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced) than individual market trading. In perfectly competitive markets studied in the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. Industrial organization generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price. It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions. Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition, various forms of oligopoly, and monopoly. Managerial economics applies microeconomic analysis to specific decisions in business firms or other management units. It draws heavily from quantitative methods such as operations research and programming and from statistical methods such as regression analysis in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge. A unifying theme is the attempt to optimize business decisions, including unit-cost minimization and profit maximization, given the firm\\'s objectives and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions. Uncertainty and game theory. Uncertainty in economics is an unknown prospect of gain or loss, whether quantifiable as risk or not. Without it, household behaviour would be unaffected by uncertain employment and income prospects, financial and capital markets would reduce to exchange of a single instrument in each market period, and there would be no communications industry. Given its different forms, there are various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents\\' responses to it. Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that considers strategic interactions between agents, one kind of uncertainty. It provides a mathematical foundation of industrial organization, discussed above, to model different types of firm behaviour, for example in a solipsistic industry (few sellers), but equally applicable to wage negotiations, bargaining, contract design, and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other. In behavioural economics, it has been used to model the strategies agents choose when interacting with others whose interests are at least partially adverse to their own. In this, it generalizes maximization approaches developed to analyse market actors such as in the supply and demand model and allows for incomplete information of actors. The field dates from the 1944 classic \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\" by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern. It has significant applications seemingly outside of economics in such diverse subjects as the formulation of nuclear strategies, ethics, political science, and evolutionary biology. Risk aversion may stimulate activity that in well-functioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk, as in markets for insurance, commodity futures contracts, and financial instruments. Financial economics or simply finance describes the allocation of financial resources. It also analyses the pricing of financial instruments, the financial structure of companies, the efficiency and fragility of financial markets, financial crises, and related government policy or regulation. Some market organizations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty. Based on George Akerlof\\'s \"Market for Lemons\" article, the paradigm example is of a dodgy second-hand car market. Customers without knowledge of whether a car is a \"lemon\" depress its price below what a quality second-hand car would be. Information asymmetry arises here, if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it. Related problems in insurance are adverse selection, such that those at most risk are most likely to insure (say reckless drivers), and moral hazard, such that insurance results in riskier behaviour (say more reckless driving). Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency by driving otherwise willing transactors from the market (\"incomplete markets\"). Moreover, attempting to reduce one problem, say adverse selection by mandating insurance, may add to another, say moral hazard. Information economics, which studies such problems, has relevance in subjects such as insurance, contract law, mechanism design, monetary economics, and health care. Applied subjects include market and legal remedies to spread or reduce risk, such as warranties, government-mandated partial insurance, restructuring or bankruptcy law, inspection, and regulation for quality and information disclosure. Market failure. The term \"market failure\" encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions. Although economists categorize market failures differently, the following categories emerge in the main texts. Information asymmetries and incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies, as discussed above. Natural monopoly, or the overlapping concepts of \"practical\" and \"technical\" monopoly, is an extreme case of \"failure of competition\" as a restraint on producers. Extreme economies of scale are one possible cause. Public goods are goods which are under-supplied in a typical market. The defining features are that people can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at the same time. Externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price distortions caused by these externalities. Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply. In many areas, some form of price stickiness is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics. Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition. Some specialized fields of economics deal in market failure more than others. The economics of the public sector is one example. Much environmental economics concerns externalities or \"public bads\". Policy options include regulations that reflect cost-benefit analysis or market solutions that change incentives, such as emission fees or redefinition of property rights. Welfare. Welfare economics uses microeconomics techniques to evaluate well-being from allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy, often relative to competitive general equilibrium. It analyzes \"social welfare\", however measured, in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered. Accordingly, individuals, with associated economic activities, are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare, whether of a group, a community, or a society, and there is no \"social welfare\" apart from the \"welfare\" associated with its individual units. Macroeconomics. Macroeconomics, another branch of economics, examines the economy as a whole to explain broad aggregates and their interactions \"top down\", that is, using a simplified form of general-equilibrium theory. Such aggregates include national income and output, the unemployment rate, and price inflation and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components. It also studies effects of monetary policy and fiscal policy. Since at least the 1960s, macroeconomics has been characterized by further integration as to micro-based modelling of sectors, including rationality of players, efficient use of market information, and imperfect competition. This has addressed a long-standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject. Macroeconomic analysis also considers factors affecting the long-term level and growth of national income. Such factors include capital accumulation, technological change and labour force growth. Growth. \"Growth economics\" studies factors that explain economic growth\\xa0– the increase in output \"per capita\" of a country over a long period of time. The same factors are used to explain differences in the \"level\" of output \"per capita\" \"between\" countries, in particular why some countries grow faster than others, and whether countries converge at the same rates of growth. Much-studied factors include the rate of investment, population growth, and technological change. These are represented in theoretical and empirical forms (as in the neoclassical and endogenous growth models) and in growth accounting. Business cycle. The economics of a depression were the spur for the creation of \"macroeconomics\" as a separate discipline. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes authored a book entitled \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\" outlining the key theories of Keynesian economics. Keynes contended that aggregate demand for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns, leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output. He therefore advocated active policy responses by the public sector, including monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government to stabilize output over the business cycle. Thus, a central conclusion of Keynesian economics is that, in some situations, no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards full employment levels. John Hicks\\' IS/LM model has been the most influential interpretation of \"The General Theory\". Over the years, understanding of the business cycle has branched into various research programmes, mostly related to or distinct from Keynesianism. The neoclassical synthesis refers to the reconciliation of Keynesian economics with classical economics, stating that Keynesianism is correct in the short run but qualified by classical-like considerations in the intermediate and long run. New classical macroeconomics, as distinct from the Keynesian view of the business cycle, posits market clearing with imperfect information. It includes Friedman\\'s permanent income hypothesis on consumption and \"rational expectations\" theory, led by Robert Lucas, and real business cycle theory. In contrast, the new Keynesian approach retains the rational expectations assumption, however it assumes a variety of market failures. In particular, New Keynesians assume prices and wages are \"sticky\", which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions. Thus, the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full employment, whereas the new Keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run, and hence government and central-bank policies are needed because the \"long run\" may be very long. Unemployment. The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force. The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. People who are retired, pursuing education, or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labour force. Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes. Classical models of unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment. Structural unemployment covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers\\' skills and the skills required for open jobs. Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand. Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process. While some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy, cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates. Okun\\'s law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth. The original version of Okun\\'s law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment. Monetary policy. Money is a \"means of final payment\" for goods in most price system economies, and is the unit of account in which prices are typically stated. Money has general acceptability, relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elasticity in supply, and longevity with mass public confidence. It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits. It has been described as a social convention, like language, useful to one largely because it is useful to others. In the words of Francis Amasa Walker, a well-known 19th-century economist, \"Money is what money does\" (\"Money is \"that\" money does\" in the original). As a medium of exchange, money facilitates trade. It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with barter (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate double coincidence of wants as to what is exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces. At the level of an economy, theory and evidence are consistent with a positive relationship running from the total money supply to the nominal value of total output and to the general price level. For this reason, management of the money supply is a key aspect of monetary policy. Fiscal policy. Governments implement fiscal policy to influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand. When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy, there is an output gap where some productive capacity is left unemployed. Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand. Resources that have been idled can be used by the government. For example, unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending, which boosts aggregate demand. Both tax cuts and spending have multiplier effects where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity. The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by crowding out. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government uses resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed. Sceptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of Ricardian equivalence. They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases, which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase. Under Ricardian equivalence, any boost in demand from tax cuts will be offset by the increased saving intended to pay for future higher taxes. Inequality. Economic inequality includes income inequality, measured using the distribution of income (the amount of money people receive), and wealth inequality measured using the distribution of wealth (the amount of wealth people own), and other measures such as consumption, land ownership, and human capital. Inequality exists at different extents between countries or states, groups of people, and individuals. There are many methods for measuring inequality, the Gini coefficient being widely used for income differences among individuals. An example measure of inequality between countries is the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, a composite index that takes inequality into account. Important concepts of equality include equity, equality of outcome, and equality of opportunity. Research has linked economic inequality to political and social instability, including revolution, democratic breakdown and civil conflict. Research suggests that greater inequality hinders economic growth and macroeconomic stability, and that land and human capital inequality reduce growth more than inequality of income. Inequality is at the center stage of economic policy debate across the globe, as government tax and spending policies have significant effects on income distribution. In advanced economies, taxes and transfers decrease income inequality by one-third, with most of this being achieved via public social spending (such as pensions and family benefits.) Other branches of economics. Public economics. Public economics is the field of economics that deals with economic activities of a public sector, usually government. The subject addresses such matters as tax incidence (who really pays a particular tax), cost-benefit analysis of government programmes, effects on economic efficiency and income distribution of different kinds of spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of public choice theory, models public-sector behaviour analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats. Much of economics is positive, seeking to describe and predict economic phenomena. Normative economics seeks to identify what economies \"ought\" to be like. Welfare economics is a normative branch of economics that uses microeconomic techniques to simultaneously determine the allocative efficiency within an economy and the income distribution associated with it. It attempts to measure social welfare by examining the economic activities of the individuals that comprise society. International economics. International trade studies determinants of goods-and-services flows across international boundaries. It also concerns the size and distribution of gains from trade. Policy applications include estimating the effects of changing tariff rates and trade quotas. International finance is a macroeconomic field which examines the flow of capital across international borders, and the effects of these movements on exchange rates. Increased trade in goods, services and capital between countries is a major effect of contemporary globalization. Labor economics. Labor economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labor. Labor markets function through the interaction of workers and employers. Labor economics looks at the suppliers of labor services (workers), the demands of labor services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income. In economics, labor is a measure of the work done by human beings. It is conventionally contrasted with such other factors of production as land and capital. There are theories which have developed a concept called human capital (referring to the skills that workers possess, not necessarily their actual work), although there are also counter posing macro-economic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms. Development economics. Development economics examines economic aspects of the economic development process in relatively low-income countries focusing on structural change, poverty, and economic growth. Approaches in development economics frequently incorporate social and political factors. Criticism. Economics has historically been subject to criticism that it relies on unrealistic, unverifiable, or highly simplified assumptions, in some cases because these assumptions simplify the proofs of desired conclusions. For example, the economist Friedrich Hayek claimed that economics (at least historically) used a scientistic approach which he claimed was \"decidedly unscientific in the true sense of the word, since it involves a mechanical and uncritical application of habits of thought to fields different from those in which they have been formed\". Latter-day examples of such assumptions include perfect information, profit maximization and rational choices, axioms of neoclassical economics. Such criticisms often conflate neoclassical economics with all of contemporary economics. The field of information economics includes both mathematical-economical research and also behavioural economics, akin to studies in behavioural psychology, and confounding factors to the neoclassical assumptions are the subject of substantial study in many areas of economics. Prominent historical mainstream economists such as Keynes and Joskow observed that much of the economics of their time was conceptual rather than quantitative, and difficult to model and formalize quantitatively. In a discussion on oligopoly research, Paul Joskow pointed out in 1975 that in practice, serious students of actual economies tended to use \"informal models\" based upon qualitative factors specific to particular industries. Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were \"trotted out \"ex post\"\". He argued that formal models were largely not important in the empirical work, either, and that the fundamental factor behind the theory of the firm, behaviour, was neglected. Deirdre McCloskey has argued that many empirical economic studies are poorly reported, and she and Stephen Ziliak argue that although her critique has been well-received, practice has not improved. The extent to which practice has improved since the early 2000s is contested: although economists have noted the discipline\\'s adoption of increasingly rigorous modeling, other have criticized the field\\'s focus on creating computer simulations detached from reality, as well as noting the loss of prestige suffered by the field for failing to anticipate the Great Recession. Economics has been derogatorily dubbed \"the dismal science\", first coined by the Victorian historian Thomas Carlyle in the 19th century. It is often stated that Carlyle gave it this nickname as a response to the work of Thomas Robert Malthus, who predicted widespread starvation resulting from projections that population growth would exceed the rate of increase in the food supply. However, the actual phrase was coined by Carlyle in the context of a debate with John Stuart Mill on slavery, in which Carlyle argued for slavery; the \"dismal\" nature of economics in Carlyle\\'s view was that it \"[found] the secret of this Universe in \\'supply and demand\\', and reduc[ed] the duty of human governors to that of letting men alone\".\" Related subjects. Economics is one social science among several and has fields bordering on other areas, including economic geography, economic history, public choice, energy economics, , family economics and institutional economics. Law and economics, or economic analysis of law, is an approach to legal theory that applies methods of economics to law. It includes the use of economic concepts to explain the effects of legal rules, to assess which legal rules are economically efficient, and to predict what the legal rules will be. A seminal article by Ronald Coase published in 1961 suggested that well-defined property rights could overcome the problems of externalities. Political economy is the interdisciplinary study that combines economics, law, and political science in explaining how political institutions, the political environment, and the economic system (capitalist, socialist, mixed) influence each other. It studies questions such as how monopoly, rent-seeking behaviour, and externalities should impact government policy. Historians have employed \"political economy\" to explore the ways in the past that persons and groups with common economic interests have used politics to effect changes beneficial to their interests. Energy economics is a broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to energy supply and energy demand. Georgescu-Roegen reintroduced the concept of entropy in relation to economics and energy from thermodynamics, as distinguished from what he viewed as the mechanistic foundation of neoclassical economics drawn from Newtonian physics. His work contributed significantly to thermoeconomics and to ecological economics. He also did foundational work which later developed into evolutionary economics. The sociological subfield of economic sociology arose, primarily through the work of Émile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel, as an approach to analysing the effects of economic phenomena in relation to the overarching social paradigm (i.e. modernity). Classic works include Max Weber\\'s \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\" (1905) and Georg Simmel\\'s \"The Philosophy of Money\" (1900). More recently, the works of James S. Coleman, Mark Granovetter, Peter Hedstrom and Richard Swedberg have been influential in this field. Gary Becker in 1974 presented an economic theory of social interactions, whose applications included the family, charity, merit goods and multiperson interactions, and envy and hatred. He and Kevin Murphy authored a book in 2001 that analyzed market behavior in a social environment. Profession. The professionalization of economics, reflected in the growth of graduate programmes on the subject, has been described as \"the main change in economics since around 1900\". Most major universities and many colleges have a major, school, or department in which academic degrees are awarded in the subject, whether in the liberal arts, business, or for professional study. See Bachelor of Economics and Master of Economics. In the private sector, professional economists are employed as consultants and in industry, including banking and finance. Economists also work for various government departments and agencies, for example, the national treasury, central bank or National Bureau of Statistics. See Economic analyst. There are dozens of prizes awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions to the field, the most prominent of which is the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, though it is not a Nobel Prize. Contemporary economics uses mathematics. Economists draw on the tools of calculus, linear algebra, statistics, game theory, and computer science. Professional economists are expected to be familiar with these tools, while a minority specialize in econometrics and mathematical methods. Women in economics. Harriet Martineau (1802–1876) was a widely-read populariser of classical economic thought. Mary Paley Marshall (1850–1944), the first women lecturer at a British economics faculty, wrote \"The Economics of Industry\" with her husband Alfred Marshall. Joan Robinson (1903–1983) was an important post-Keynesian economist. The economic historian Anna Schwartz (1915–2012) coauthored \"A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960\" with Milton Friedman. Two women have received the Nobel Prize in Economics: Elinor Ostrom (2009) and Esther Duflo (2019). Five have received the John Bates Clark Medal: Susan Athey (2007), Esther Duflo (2010), Amy Finkelstein (2012), Emi Nakamura (2019) and Melissa Dell (2020). Women\\'s authorship share in prominent economic journals reduced from 1940 to the 1970s, but has subsequently risen, with different patterns of gendered coauthorship. Women remain globally under-represented in the profession (19% of authors in the RePEc database in 2018), with national variation.',\n",
       " 'Glenn Theodore Seaborg ( ; April 19, 1912February 25, 1999) was an American chemist whose involvement in the synthesis, discovery and investigation of ten transuranium elements earned him a share of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. His work in this area also led to his development of the actinide concept and the arrangement of the actinide series in the periodic table of the elements. Seaborg spent most of his career as an educator and research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, serving as a professor, and, between 1958 and 1961, as the university\\'s second chancellor. He advised ten US presidents—from Harry S. Truman to Bill Clinton—on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial nuclear energy and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the Franck Report and contributed to the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the Eisenhower administration, he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President Ronald Reagan\\'s National Commission on Excellence in Education, he was a key contributor to its 1983 report \"A Nation at Risk\". Seaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named seaborgium in his honor. He said about this naming, \"This is the greatest honor ever bestowed upon me--even better, I think, than winning the Nobel Prize. Future students of chemistry, in learning about the periodic table, may have reason to ask why the element was named for me, and thereby learn more about my work.\" He also discovered more than 100 isotopes of transuranium elements and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the implosion-type atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series. After sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Edwin McMillan, he received approximately 50 honorary doctorates and numerous other awards and honors. The list of things named after Seaborg ranges from the chemical element seaborgium to the asteroid 4856 Seaborg. He was a prolific author, penning numerous books and 500 journal articles, often in collaboration with others. He was once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the person with the longest entry in \"Who\\'s Who in America\". Early life. Glenn Theodore Seaborg was born in Ishpeming, Michigan, on April 19, 1912, the son of Herman Theodore (Ted) and Selma Olivia Erickson Seaborg. He had one sister, Jeanette, who was two years younger. His family spoke Swedish at home. When Glenn Seaborg was a boy, the family moved to Los Angeles County, California, settling in a subdivision called Home Gardens, later annexed to the City of South Gate, California. About this time he changed the spelling of his first name from Glen to Glenn. Seaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 until he suffered a stroke in 1998. As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged him to become a bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at David Starr Jordan High School in Watts. Seaborg graduated from Jordan in 1929 at the top of his class and received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in chemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1933. He worked his way through school as a stevedore and a laboratory assistant at Firestone. Seaborg received his PhD in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1937 with a doctoral thesis on the \"Interaction of Fast Neutrons with Lead\", in which he coined the term \"nuclear spallation\". Seaborg was a member of the professional chemistry fraternity Alpha Chi Sigma. As a graduate student in the 1930s Seaborg performed wet chemistry research for his advisor Gilbert Newton Lewis, and published three papers with him on the theory of acids and bases. Seaborg studied the text \"Applied Radiochemistry\" by Otto Hahn, of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, and it had a major impact on his developing interests as a research scientist. For several years, Seaborg conducted important research in artificial radioactivity using the Lawrence cyclotron at UC Berkeley. He was excited to learn from others that nuclear fission was possible—but also chagrined, as his own research might have led him to the same discovery. Seaborg also became an adept interlocutor of Berkeley physicist Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation and often answered a junior colleague\\'s question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly. Pioneering work in nuclear chemistry. Seaborg remained at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed Frederick Soddy\\'s work investigating isotopes and contributed to the discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence\\'s advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the hemoglobin in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131, which is still used to treat thyroid disease. (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg\\'s mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes. In 1939 he became an instructor in chemistry at Berkeley, was promoted to assistant professor in 1941 and professor in 1945. University of California, Berkeley, physicist Edwin McMillan led a team that discovered element 93, which he named neptunium in 1940. In November, he was persuaded to leave Berkeley temporarily to assist with urgent research in radar technology. Since Seaborg and his colleagues had perfected McMillan\\'s oxidation-reduction technique for isolating neptunium, he asked McMillan for permission to continue the research and search for element 94. McMillan agreed to the collaboration. Seaborg first reported alpha decay proportionate to only a fraction of the element 93 under observation. The first hypothesis for this alpha particle accumulation was contamination by uranium, which produces alpha-decay particles; analysis of alpha-decay particles ruled this out. Seaborg then postulated that a distinct alpha-producing element was being formed from element 93. In February 1941, Seaborg and his collaborators produced plutonium-239 through the bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93. But it then underwent beta-decay, forming a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Plutonium is fairly stable, but undergoes alpha-decay, which explained the presence of alpha particles coming from neptunium. Thus, on March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist Emilio Segrè and Berkeley chemist Joseph W. Kennedy were able to show that plutonium (then known only as element 94) was fissile, an important distinction that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research. In 1966, Room 307 of Gilman Hall on the campus at the Berkeley, where Seaborg did his work, was declared a US National Historic Landmark. In addition to plutonium, he is credited as a lead discoverer of americium, curium, and berkelium, and as a co-discoverer of californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and seaborgium, the first element named after a living person. He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951 with Edwin McMillan for \"their discoveries in the chemistry of the first transuranium elements.\" Scientific contributions during the Manhattan Project. On April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago and joined the chemistry group at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where Enrico Fermi and his group would later convert uranium-238 to plutonium-239 in a controlled nuclear chain reaction. Seaborg\\'s role was to figure out how to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of uranium. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg\\'s Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the Clinton Engineering Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and then entered full-scale production at the Hanford Engineer Works, in Richland, Washington. Seaborg\\'s theoretical development of the actinide concept resulted in a redrawing of the periodic table into its current configuration with the actinide series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element\\'s short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household smoke detectors and thus provided a good source of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese. Professor and Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley. After the conclusion of World War II and the Manhattan Project, Seaborg was eager to return to academic life and university research free from the restrictions of wartime secrecy. In 1946, he added to his responsibilities as a professor by heading the nuclear chemistry research at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory operated by the University of California on behalf of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Seaborg was named one of the \"Ten Outstanding Young Men in America\" by the US Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1947 (along with Richard Nixon and others). Seaborg was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1948. From 1954 to 1961 he served as associate director of the radiation laboratory. He was appointed by President Truman to serve as a member of the General Advisory Committee of the AEC, an assignment he retained until 1960. Seaborg served as chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1961. His term coincided with a relaxation of McCarthy-era restrictions on students\\' freedom of expression that had begun under his predecessor, Clark Kerr. In October 1958, Seaborg announced that the university had relaxed its prior prohibitions on political activity on a trial basis, and the ban on communists speaking on campus was lifted. This paved the way for the Free Speech Movement of 1964-1965. Seaborg was an enthusiastic supporter of Cal\\'s sports teams. San Francisco columnist Herb Caen was fond of pointing out that Seaborg\\'s surname is an anagram of \"Go Bears\", a popular cheer at UC Berkeley. Seaborg was proud of the fact that the Cal Bears won their first and only National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball championship in 1959, while he was chancellor. The football team also won the conference title and played in the Rose Bowl that year. He served on the Faculty Athletic Committee for several years and was the co-author of a book, \"Roses from the Ashes: Breakup and Rebirth in Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Athletics\" (2000), concerning the Pacific Coast Conference recruiting scandal, and the founding of what is now the Pac-12, in which he played a role in restoring confidence in the integrity of collegiate sports. Seaborg served on the President\\'s Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) during the Eisenhower administration. PSAC produced a report on \"Scientific Progress, the Universities, and the Federal Government\", also known as the \"Seaborg Report\", in November 1960, that urged greater federal funding of science. In 1959, he helped found the Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory with Clark Kerr. Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. After appointment by President John F. Kennedy and confirmation by the United States Senate, Seaborg was chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) from 1961 to 1971. During this time he advised 10 US presidents. His pending appointment by President-elect Kennedy was nearly derailed in late 1960 when members of the Kennedy transition team learned that Seaborg had been listed in a \"U.S. News & World Report\" article as a member of \"Nixon\\'s Idea Men\". Seaborg said that as a lifetime Democrat he was baffled when the article appeared associating him with outgoing Vice President Richard Nixon, a Republican whom Seaborg considered a casual acquaintance. During the early 1960s, Seaborg became concerned with the ecological and biological effects of nuclear weapons, especially those that would impact human life significantly. In response, he commissioned the Technical Analysis Branch of the AEC to study these matters further. Seaborg\\'s provision for these innovative studies led the US Government to more seriously pursue the development and possible use of \"clean\" nuclear weapons. While chairman of the AEC, Seaborg participated on the negotiating team for the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), in which the US, UK, and USSR agreed to ban all above-ground test detonations of nuclear weapons. Seaborg considered his contributions to the achievement of the LTBT as one of his greatest accomplishments. Despite strict rules from the Soviets about photography at the signing ceremony, Seaborg used a tiny camera to take a close-up photograph of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev as he signed the treaty. Seaborg enjoyed a close relationship with President Lyndon Johnson and influenced the administration to pursue the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Seaborg was called to the White House in the first week of the Nixon Administration in January 1969 to advise President Richard Nixon on his first diplomatic crisis involving the Soviets and nuclear testing. He clashed with Nixon presidential adviser John Ehrlichman over the treatment of a Jewish scientist, Zalman Shapiro, whom the Nixon administration suspected of leaking nuclear secrets to Israel. Seaborg published several books and journal articles during his tenure at the AEC. He predicted the existence of elements beyond those on the periodic table, the transactinide series and the superactinide series of undiscovered synthetic elements. While most of these theoretical future elements have extremely short half-lives and thus no expected practical applications, he also hypothesized the existence of stable super-heavy isotopes of certain elements in an island of stability. Seaborg served as chairman of the AEC until 1971. Return to California. Following his service as Chairman of the AEC, Seaborg returned to UC Berkeley where he was awarded the position of University Professor. At the time, there had been fewer University Professors at UC Berkeley than Nobel Prize winners. He also served as Chairman of the Lawrence Hall of Science where he became the principal investigator for Great Explorations in Math and Science (GEMS) working with director Jacqueline Barber. Seaborg served as chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1961, and served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1972 and as president of the American Chemical Society in 1976. In 1980, he transmuted several thousand atoms of bismuth-209 into gold at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. His experimental technique, using the lab\\'s Bevalac particle accelerator, was able to remove protons and neutrons from the bismuth atoms by bombarding it with carbon and neon nuclei traveling near the speed of light. Seaborg\\'s technique would have been far too expensive to enable routine manufacturing of gold, but his work was close to the mythical Philosopher\\'s Stone. As gold has four fewer protons and (taking the only naturally occurring bulk isotopes of either) eight fewer neutrons than bismuth, a total of twelve nucleons have to be removed from the bismuth nucleus to produce gold using Seaborg\\'s method. In 1981, Seaborg became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed Seaborg to serve on the National Commission on Excellence in Education. The commission produced a report \"A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform\", which focused national attention on education as a national issue germane to the federal government. In 2008, Margaret Spellings wrote that Seaborg lived most of his later life in Lafayette, California, where he devoted himself to editing and publishing the journals that documented both his early life and later career. He rallied a group of scientists who criticized the science curriculum in the state of California, which he viewed as far too socially oriented and not nearly focused enough on hard science. California Governor Pete Wilson appointed Seaborg to head a committee that proposed changes to California\\'s science curriculum despite outcries from labor organizations and others. Personal life. In 1942, Seaborg married Helen Griggs, the secretary of physicist Ernest Lawrence. Under wartime pressure, Seaborg had moved to Chicago while engaged to Griggs. When Seaborg returned to accompany Griggs for the journey back to Chicago, friends expected them to marry in Chicago. But, eager to be married, Seaborg and Griggs impulsively got off the train in the town of Caliente, Nevada, for what they thought would be a quick wedding. When they asked for City Hall, they found Caliente had none—they would have to travel north to Pioche, the county seat. With no car, this was no easy feat, but one of Caliente\\'s newest deputy sheriffs turned out to be a recent graduate of the Cal Berkeley chemistry department and was more than happy to do a favor for Seaborg. The deputy sheriff arranged for the wedding couple to ride up and back to Pioche in a mail truck. The witnesses at the Seaborg wedding were a clerk and a janitor. Glenn Seaborg and Helen Griggs Seaborg had seven children, of whom the first, Peter Glenn Seaborg, died in 1997 (his twin Paulette having died in infancy). The others were Lynne Seaborg Cobb, David Seaborg, Steve Seaborg, Eric Seaborg, and Dianne Seaborg. Seaborg was an avid hiker. Upon becoming Chairman of the AEC in 1961, he commenced taking daily hikes through a trail that he blazed at the headquarters site in Germantown, Maryland. He frequently invited colleagues and visitors to accompany him, and the trail became known as the \"Glenn Seaborg Trail.\" He and his wife Helen are credited with blazing a trail in the East Bay area near their home in Lafayette, California. This trail has since become a part of the American Hiking Association\\'s cross-country network of trails. Seaborg and his wife walked the trail network from Contra Costa County all the way to the California–Nevada border. Seaborg was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1972 and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) of London in 1985. He was honored as Swedish-American of the Year in 1962 by the Vasa Order of America. In 1991, the organization named \"Local Lodge Glenn T. Seaborg No. 719\" in his honor during the Seaborg Honors ceremony at which he appeared. This lodge maintains a scholarship fund in his name, as does the unrelated Swedish-American Club of Los Angeles. Seaborg kept a close bond to his Swedish origin. He visited Sweden every so often, and his family were members of the Swedish \"Pemer Genealogical Society\", a family association open for every descendant of the Pemer family, a Swedish family with German origin, from which Seaborg was descended on his mother\\'s side. (In recent years, after both men\\'s passings, it has been discovered that physicist colleague Edward J. Lofgren was also descended from the Pemer family.) Seaborg even responded to the Swedish king\\'s Nobel prize toast in his mother\\'s native region\\'s dialect, which he described as \"It was as if a Swede had \"y\\'alled\" in English with a Southern Accent.\"\". Death. On August 24, 1998, while in Boston to attend a meeting by the American Chemical Society, Seaborg suffered a stroke, which led to his death six months later on February 25, 1999, at his home in Lafayette. Honors and awards. During his lifetime, Seaborg is said to have been the author or co-author of numerous books and 500 scientific journal articles, many of them brief reports on fast-breaking discoveries in nuclear science while other subjects, most notably the actinide concept, represented major theoretical contributions in the history of science. He held more than 40 patents—among them the only patents ever issued for chemical elements, americium and curium, and received more than 50 doctorates and honorary degrees in his lifetime. At one time, he was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as having the longest entry in Marquis \"Who\\'s Who in America\". In February 2005, he was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In April 2011 the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) selected Seaborg for inclusion in CSI\\'s Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism. His papers are in the Library of Congress. Seaborg was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1948, the American Philosophical Society in 1952, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. The American Chemical Society-Chicago Section honored him with the Willard Gibbs Award in 1966. The American Academy of Achievement presented Seaborg with the Golden Plate Award in 1972. The element seaborgium was named after Seaborg by Albert Ghiorso, E. Kenneth Hulet, and others, who also credited Seaborg as a co-discoverer. It was named while Seaborg was still alive, which proved controversial. He influenced the naming of so many elements that with the announcement of seaborgium, it was noted in \"Discover\" magazine\\'s review of the year in science that he could receive a letter addressed in chemical elements: seaborgium, lawrencium (for the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where he worked), berkelium, californium, americium. Seaborgium is the first element ever to have been officially named after a living person. The second element to be so named is oganesson, in 2016, after Yuri Oganessian.',\n",
       " 'Caratacus (Brythonic \"*Caratācos\", Middle Welsh \"Caratawc\"; Welsh \"Caradog\"; Breton \"Karadeg\"; Greek \"Καράτακος\"; variants Latin \"Caractacus\", Greek \"Καρτάκης\") was a 1st-century\\xa0AD British chieftain of the Catuvellauni tribe, who resisted the Roman conquest of Britain. Before the Roman invasion, Caratacus is associated with the expansion of his tribe\\'s territory. His apparent success led to Roman invasion, nominally in support of his defeated enemies. He resisted the Romans for almost a decade, mixing guerrilla warfare with set-piece battles, but was unsuccessful in the latter. After his final defeat he fled to the territory of Queen Cartimandua, who captured him and handed him over to the Romans. He was sentenced to death as a military prisoner, but made a speech before his execution that persuaded the Emperor Claudius to spare him. The legendary Welsh character Caradog ap Bran and the legendary British king Arvirargus may be based upon Caratacus. Caratacus\\'s speech to Claudius has been a common subject in art. Name. Caratacus\\'s name appears as both \"Caratacus\" and \"Caractacus\" in manuscripts of Tacitus, and as \"Καράτακος\" and \"Καρτάκης\" in manuscripts of Dio. Older reference works tend to favour the spelling \"Caractacus\", but modern scholars agree, based on historical linguistics and source criticism, that the original Common Brittonic form was \"*Karatākos\", pronounced , cognate with Welsh \"Caradog\", Breton \"Karadeg\", and Irish \"Carthach\", meaning \"loving, beloved, dear; friend\". History. Claudian invasion. Caratacus is named by Dio Cassius as a son of the Catuvellaunian king Cunobelinus. Based on coin distribution Caratacus appears to have been the protégé of his uncle Epaticcus, who expanded Catuvellaunian power westwards most likely from his palace in Verulam, the heartland of the Catuvellauni, into the territory of the Atrebates. After Epaticcus died in about AD\\xa035, the Atrebates, under Verica, regained some of their territory, but it appears Caratacus completed the conquest, as Dio tells us Verica was ousted, fled to Rome and appealed to the emperor Claudius for help. This was the excuse used by Claudius to launch his invasion of Britain in the summer of 43. The invasion targeted Caratacus\\'s stronghold of Camulodunon (modern Colchester), previously the seat of his father Cunobelinus. Cunobelinus had died some time before the invasion. Caratacus and his brother Togodumnus led the initial defence of the country against Aulus Plautius\\'s four legions, thought to have been around 40,000 men, primarily using guerrilla tactics. They lost much of the south-east after being defeated in two crucial battles, the Battle of the River Medway and River Thames. Togodumnus was killed (although both Miles Russell and John Hind argue that Dio was mistaken in reporting Togodumnus\\'s death, that he was defeated but survived, and was later appointed by the Romans as a friendly king over a number of territories, becoming the loyal king referred to by Tacitus as Cogidubnus or Togidubnus) and the Catuvellauni\\'s territories were conquered. Their stronghold of Camulodunon was converted into the first Roman colonia in Britain, Colonia Victricensis. Resistance to Rome. We next hear of Caratacus in Tacitus\\'s \"Annals\", leading the Silures and Ordovices of Wales against Plautius\\'s successor as governor, Publius Ostorius Scapula. Finally, in 50, Scapula managed to defeat Caratacus in a set-piece battle somewhere in Ordovician territory, capturing Caratacus\\'s wife and daughter and receiving the surrender of his brothers. Caratacus himself escaped, and fled north to the lands of the Brigantes (modern Yorkshire) where the Brigantian queen, Cartimandua, handed him over to the Romans in chains. This was one of the factors that led to two Brigantian revolts against Cartimandua and her Roman allies, once later in the 50s and once in 69, led by Venutius, who had once been Cartimandua\\'s husband. With the capture of Caratacus, much of southern Britain from the Humber to the Severn was pacified and garrisoned throughout the 50s. Legends place Caratacus\\'s last stand at either Caer Caradoc near Church Stretton or British Camp in the Malvern Hills, but the description of Tacitus makes either unlikely: Although the Severn is visible from British Camp, it is nowhere near it, so this battle must have taken place elsewhere. A number of locations have been suggested, including a site near Brampton Bryan. Bari Jones, in \"Archaeology Today\" in 1998, identified Blodwel Rocks at Llanymynech in Powys as representing a close fit with Tacitus\\'s account. Captive in Rome. After his capture, Caratacus was sent to Rome as a war prize, presumably to be killed after a triumphal parade. Although a captive, he was allowed to address the Roman Senate. Tacitus records a version of his speech in which he says that his stubborn resistance made Rome\\'s glory in defeating him all the greater: He made such an impression that he was pardoned and allowed to live in peace in Rome. After his liberation, according to Dio Cassius, Caratacus was so impressed by the city of Rome that he said \"And can you, then, who have got such possessions and so many of them, still covet our poor huts?\" Legend. Medieval Welsh traditions. Caratacus\\'s memory may have been preserved in medieval Welsh tradition. A genealogy in the Welsh Harley MS 3859 includes the generations \"Caratauc map Cinbelin map Teuhant\", corresponding, via established processes of language change, to \"Caratacus, son of Cunobelinus, son of Tasciovanus\", preserving the names of the three historical figures in correct relationship. Caratacus does not appear in Geoffrey of Monmouth\\'s \"History of the Kings of Britain\" (1136), although he appears to correspond to Arviragus, the younger son of Kymbelinus, who continues to resist the Roman invasion after the death of his older brother Guiderius. In Welsh versions his name is Gweirydd, son of Cynfelyn, and his brother is called Gwydyr; the name Arviragus is taken from a poem by Juvenal. Caradog, son of Bran, who appears in medieval Welsh literature, has also been identified with Caratacus, although nothing in the medieval legend corresponds except his name. He appears in the \"Mabinogion\" as a son of Bran the Blessed, who is left in charge of Britain while his father makes war in Ireland, but is overthrown by Caswallawn (the historical Cassivellaunus, who lived a century earlier than Caratacus). The Welsh Triads agree that he was Bran\\'s son, and name two sons, Cawrdaf and Eudaf. Two hills in Shropshire bear the name Caer Caradoc (Welsh – Caer Caradog), meaning fort of Caradoc, and have popular associations with him. One is an Iron Age hill fort and Scheduled Monument near the town of Clun. It overlooks the village of Chapel Lawn. The other Caer Caradoc is a prominent hill and Iron Age hill fort near Church Stretton, 16 miles (26\\xa0km) to the north-east. Modern traditions. Caradog only began to be identified with Caratacus after the rediscovery of the works of Tacitus, and new material appeared based on this identification. An 18th-century tradition, popularised by the Welsh antiquarian and forger Iolo Morganwg, credits Caradog, on his return from imprisonment in Rome, with the introduction of Christianity to Britain. Iolo also makes the legendary king Coel Hen a son of Caradog\\'s son Saint Cyllin. Richard Williams Morgan claimed that a reference to Cyllin as a son of Caratacus was found in the family records of Iestyn ab Gwrgant and used this as evidence of the early entry of Christianity to Britain: \"Cyllin ab Caradog, a wise and just king. In his days many of the Cymry embraced the faith in Christ through the teaching of the saints of Cor-Eurgain, and many godly men from the countries of Greece and Rome were in Cambria. He first of the Cymry gave infants names; for before, names were not given except to adults, and then from something characteristic in their bodies, minds, or manners.\" Another tradition, which has remained popular among British Israelites and others, makes Caratacus already a Christian before he came to Rome, Christianity having been brought to Britain by either Joseph of Arimathea or St. Paul, and identifies a number of early Christians as his relatives. One is Pomponia Graecina, wife of Aulus Plautius, the conqueror of Britain, who as Tacitus relates, was accused of following a \"foreign superstition\", which the tradition considers to be Christianity. Tacitus describes her as the \"wife of the Plautius who returned from Britain with an ovation\", which led John Lingard (1771–1851) to conclude, in his \"History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church\", that she was British; however, this conclusion is a misinterpretation of what Tacitus wrote. An ovation was a military parade in honour of a victorious general, so the person who \"returned from Britain with an ovation\" is clearly Plautius, not Pomponia. This has not prevented the error being repeated and disseminated widely. Another is Claudia Rufina, a historical British woman known to the poet Martial. Martial describes Claudia\\'s marriage to a man named Pudens, almost certainly Aulus Pudens, an Umbrian centurion and friend of the poet who appears regularly in his \"Epigrams\". It has been argued since the 17th century that this pair may be the same as the Claudia and Pudens mentioned as members of the Roman Christian community in \"2 Timothy\" in the New Testament. Some go further, claiming that Claudia was Caratacus\\' daughter, and that the historical Pope Linus, who is described as the \"brother of Claudia\" in an early church document, was Caratacus\\' son. Pudens is identified with St. Pudens, and it is claimed that the basilica of Santa Pudenziana in Rome, and with which St. Pudens is associated, was once called the \"Palatium Britannicum\" and was the home of Caratacus and his family. This theory was popularised in a 1961 book called \"The Drama of the Lost Disciples\" by George Jowett, but Jowett did not originate it. He cites renaissance historians such as Archbishop James Ussher, Caesar Baronius and John Hardyng, as well as classical writers like Caesar, Tacitus and Juvenal, although his classical citations at least are wildly inaccurate, many of his assertions are unsourced, and many of his identifications entirely speculative. He also regularly cites \"St. Paul in Britain\", an 1860 book by R. W. Morgan, and advocates other tenets of British Israelism, in particular that the British are descended from the lost tribes of Israel.',\n",
       " 'Luciano Pavarotti (, , ; 12 October 19356 September 2007) was an Italian operatic tenor who during the late part of his career crossed over into popular music, eventually becoming one of the most acclaimed tenors of all time. He made numerous recordings of complete operas and individual arias, gaining worldwide fame for his tone, and gaining the nickname \"King of the High Cs\". As one of the Three Tenors, who performed their first concert during the 1990 FIFA World Cup before a global audience, Pavarotti became well known for his televised concerts and media appearances. From the beginning of his professional career as a tenor in 1961 in Italy to his final performance of \"Nessun dorma\" at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Pavarotti was at his best in bel canto operas, pre-\"Aida\" Verdi roles, and Puccini works such as \"La bohème\", \"Tosca\", \"Turandot\" and \"Madama Butterfly\". He sold over 100 million records, and the first Three Tenors recording became the best-selling classical album of all time. Pavarotti was also noted for his charity work on behalf of refugees and the Red Cross, amongst others. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1988, and died from pancreatic cancer on 6 September 2007. Biography. Early life and musical training. Luciano Pavarotti was born in 1935 on the outskirts of Modena in Northern Italy, the son of Fernando Pavarotti, a baker and amateur tenor, and Adele Venturi, a cigar factory worker. Although he spoke fondly of his childhood, the family had little money; its four members were crowded into a two-room apartment. According to Pavarotti, his father had a fine tenor voice but rejected the possibility of a singing career because of nervousness. World War II forced the family out of the city in 1943. For the following year they rented a single room from a farmer in the neighbouring countryside, where the young Pavarotti developed an interest in farming. After abandoning the dream of becoming a football goalkeeper, Pavarotti spent seven years in vocal training. Pavarotti\\'s earliest musical influences were his father\\'s records, most of them featuring the popular tenors of the day—Beniamino Gigli, Giovanni Martinelli, Tito Schipa, and Enrico Caruso. Pavarotti\\'s favourite tenor and idol was Giuseppe Di Stefano and he was also deeply influenced by Mario Lanza, saying: \"In my teens I used to go to Mario Lanza movies and then come home and imitate him in the mirror\". At around the age of nine he began singing with his father in a small local church choir. In addition to music, as a child Pavarotti enjoyed playing football. When he graduated from the Scuola Magistrale he was interested in pursuing a career as a professional football goalkeeper, but his mother convinced him to train as a teacher. He subsequently taught in an elementary school for two years but finally decided to pursue a music career. His father, recognising the risk involved, only reluctantly gave his consent. Pavarotti began the serious study of music in 1954 at the age of 19 with Arrigo Pola, a respected teacher and professional tenor in Modena who offered to teach him without remuneration. According to conductor Richard Bonynge, Pavarotti never learned to read music. In 1955, he experienced his first singing success when he was a member of the Corale Rossini, a male voice choir from Modena that also included his father, which won first prize at the International Eisteddfod in Llangollen, Wales. He later said that this was the most important experience of his life, and that it inspired him to become a professional singer. At about this time Pavarotti first met Adua Veroni. They married in 1961. When his teacher Arrigo Pola moved to Japan, Pavarotti became a student of Ettore Campogalliani, who at that time was also teaching Pavarotti\\'s childhood friend, Mirella Freni, whose mother worked with Luciano\\'s mother in the cigar factory. Like Pavarotti, Freni went on to become a successful opera singer; they would go on to collaborate in various stage performances and recordings together. During his years of musical study, Pavarotti held part-time jobs in order to sustain himself—first as an elementary school teacher and then as an insurance salesman. The first six years of study resulted in only a few recitals, all in small towns and without pay. When a nodule developed on his vocal cords, causing a \"disastrous\" concert in Ferrara, he decided to give up singing. Pavarotti attributed his immediate improvement to the psychological release connected with this decision. Whatever the reason, the nodule not only disappeared but, as he related in his autobiography: \"Everything I had learned came together with my natural voice to make the sound I had been struggling so hard to achieve\". Career: 1960s–1970s. Pavarotti began his career as a tenor in smaller regional Italian opera houses, making his debut as Rodolfo in \"La bohème\" at the Teatro Municipale in Reggio Emilia in April 1961. His first known recording of \"Che gelida manina\" was recorded during this performance. Pavarotti\\'s first of two marriages was to Adua Veroni which lasted from 1961 to 2000 and they had three daughters: Lorenza, Cristina, and Giuliana. He made his first international appearance in \"La traviata\" in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Very early in his career, on 23 February 1963, he debuted at the Vienna State Opera in the same role. In March and April 1963 Vienna saw Pavarotti again as Rodolfo and as Duca di Mantova in \"Rigoletto\". The same year saw his first concert outside Italy when he sang in Dundalk, Ireland for the St Cecilia\\'s Gramophone Society, he was engaged by the Dublin Grand Opera Society to sing The Duke of Mantua in Verdi\\'s Rigoletto in May and June, and his Royal Opera House debut, where he replaced an indisposed Giuseppe Di Stefano as Rodolfo. There exist on archive.org three complete performances from Pavarotti\\'s early career in 1964, when he was engaged by the Dublin Grand Opera Society to sing Rudolfo in Giacomo Puccini\\'s \"La bohème\" (Audio recording of Presented on May 19, 21, 27, Jun 1 1964 at the Gaiety Theatre Dublin as part of the Dublin Grand Opera Society\\'s Spring Season) and Alfredo in Giuseppe Verdi\\'s \"La Traviata\" (Audio recording of Presented on Jun 8 1964 at the Gaiety Theatre Dublin as part of the Dublin Grand Opera Society\\'s Spring Season, Audio recording of Presented on May 25, 1964 at the Gaiety Theatre Dublin as part of the Dublin Grand Opera Society\\'s Spring Season). Also available are reviews of those performances in which the reviewers favorably comment on his singing (from the reviews for \"La Boheme\"): \"sang sweetly and appealingly,\" \"rich promise,\" \"outstanding,\" \"fit for the big heroic roles,\" and \"robust;\" his voice: \"pure tone\", \"arresting quality,\" \"unforced strength and range,\" \"well sustained,\" and \"lovely;\" and his acting: \"looked and moved well,\" \"sang with musically-directed intelligence,\" \"used the voice to reinforce his acting,\" and \"chief delight of the evening.\" While generally successful, Pavarotti\\'s early roles did not immediately propel him into the stardom that he would later enjoy. An early coup involved his connection with Joan Sutherland (and her conductor husband, Richard Bonynge), who in 1963 was seeking a tenor taller than herself to take along on her 1965 tour to Australia. With his commanding physical presence, Pavarotti proved ideal. However, before the summer 1965 Australia tour Pavarotti sang with Joan Sutherland when he made his American début with the Greater Miami Opera in February 1965, singing in Donizetti\\'s \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" on the stage of the Miami-Dade County Auditorium in Miami. The tenor scheduled to perform that night became ill with no understudy. As Sutherland had plans to travel with him on the Australia tour that summer, she recommended the young Pavarotti as he was acquainted with the role. Shortly after, on 28 April, Pavarotti made his La Scala debut in the revival of the Franco Zeffirelli production of \"La bohème,\" with his childhood friend Mirella Freni singing Mimi and Herbert von Karajan conducting. Karajan had requested the singer\\'s engagement. During the Australia tour in summer 1965 Sutherland and Pavarotti sang some forty performances over two months, and Pavarotti later credited Sutherland for the breathing technique that would sustain him over his career. After the extended Australian tour, he returned to La Scala, where he added Tebaldo from \"I Capuleti e i Montecchi\" to his repertoire on 26 March 1966, with Giacomo Aragall as Romeo. His first appearance as Tonio in Donizetti\\'s \"La fille du régiment\" took place at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 2 June of that year. It was his performances of this role that would earn him the title of \"King of the High Cs\". He scored another major triumph in Rome on 20 November 1969 when he sang in \"I Lombardi\" opposite Renata Scotto. This was recorded on a private label and widely distributed, as were various recordings of his \"I Capuleti e i Montecchi,\" usually with Aragall. Early commercial recordings included a recital of Donizetti (the aria from \"Don Sebastiano\" were particularly highly regarded) and Verdi arias, as well as a complete \"L\\'elisir d\\'amore\" with Sutherland. His major breakthrough in the United States came on 17 February 1972, in a production of \"La fille du régiment\" at New York\\'s Metropolitan Opera, in which he drove the crowd into a frenzy with his nine effortless high Cs in the signature aria. He achieved a record seventeen curtain calls. Pavarotti sang his international recital début at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri, on 1 February 1973, as part of the college\\'s Fine Arts Program, now known as the Harriman–Jewell Series. Perspiring due to nerves and a lingering cold, the tenor clutched a handkerchief throughout the début. The prop became a signature part of his solo performances. He began to give frequent television performances, starting with his performances as Rodolfo (\"La bohème\") in the first Live from the Met telecast in March 1977, which attracted one of the largest audiences ever for a televised opera. He won many Grammy awards and platinum and gold discs for his performances. In addition to the previously listed titles, his \"La favorite\" with Fiorenza Cossotto and his \"I puritani\" (1975) with Sutherland stand out. In 1976, Pavarotti debuted at the Salzburg Festival, appearing in a solo recital on 31 July, accompanied by pianist Leone Magiera. Pavarotti returned to the festival in 1978 with a recital and as the Italian singer in \"Der Rosenkavalier\" in 1983 with \"Idomeneo,\" and both in 1985 and 1988 with solo recitals. In 1979, he was profiled in a cover story in the weekly magazine \"Time\". That same year saw Pavarotti\\'s return to the Vienna State Opera after an absence of fourteen years. With Herbert von Karajan conducting, Pavarotti sang Manrico in \"Il trovatore.\" In 1978, he appeared in a solo recital on \"Live from Lincoln Center.\" Career: 1980s–1990s. At the beginning of the 1980s, he set up The Pavarotti International Voice Competition for young singers, performing with the winners in 1982 in excerpts of \"La bohème\" and \"L\\'elisir d\\'amore\". The second competition, in 1986, staged excerpts of \"La bohème\" and \"Un ballo in maschera\". To celebrate the 25th anniversary of his career, he brought the winners of the competition to Italy for gala performances of \"La bohème\" in Modena and Genoa, and then to China where they staged performances of \"La bohème\" in Beijing (Peking). To conclude the visit, Pavarotti performed the inaugural concert in the Great Hall of the People before 10,000 people, receiving a standing ovation for nine effortless high Cs. The third competition in 1989 again staged performances of \"L\\'elisir d\\'amore\" and \"Un ballo in maschera\". The winners of the fifth competition accompanied Pavarotti in performances in Philadelphia in 1997. In the mid-1980s, Pavarotti returned to two opera houses that had provided him with important breakthroughs, the Vienna State Opera and La Scala. Vienna saw Pavarotti as Rodolfo in \"La bohème\" with Carlos Kleiber conducting and again Mirella Freni was Mimi; as Nemorino in \"L\\'elisir d\\'amore\"; as Radames in \"Aida\" conducted by Lorin Maazel; as Rodolfo in \"Luisa Miller\"; and as Gustavo in \"Un ballo in maschera\" conducted by Claudio Abbado. In 1996, Pavarotti appeared for the last time at the Staatsoper in \"Andrea Chénier\". Throughout the 1980s and 90s, promoters Tibor Rudas and Harvey Goldsmith booked Pavarotti into increasingly larger venues. In 1985, Pavarotti sang Radames at La Scala opposite Maria Chiara in a Luca Ronconi production conducted by Maazel, recorded on video. His performance of the aria \"Celeste Aida\" received a two-minute ovation on the opening night. He was reunited with Mirella Freni for the San Francisco Opera production of \"La bohème\" in 1988, also recorded on video. In 1992, La Scala saw Pavarotti in a new Zeffirelli production of \"Don Carlos\", conducted by Riccardo Muti. Pavarotti\\'s performance was heavily criticised by some observers and booed by parts of the audience. Pavarotti became even better known throughout the world in 1990 when his rendition of the aria \"Nessun dorma\" from Giacomo Puccini\\'s \"Turandot\" was taken as the theme song of BBC\\'s coverage of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. The aria achieved pop status, became the World Cup soundtrack, and it remained his trademark song. This was followed by the first Three Tenors concert, held on the eve of the 1990 FIFA World Cup Final at the ancient Baths of Caracalla in Rome with fellow tenors Plácido Domingo and José Carreras and conductor Zubin Mehta. The performance for the World Cup closing concert captivated a global audience, and it became the biggest selling classical record of all time. A highlight of the concert, in which Pavarotti sang the opening verses using extended vocal runs for di Capua\\'s \"O Sole Mio\" and which was in turn perfectly repeated note-for-note by Domingo and Carreras to the delight of the audience. The recorded album sold millions of copies, and the first Three Tenors recording became the best-selling classical album of all time. Throughout the 1990s, Pavarotti appeared in many well-attended outdoor concerts, including his televised concert in London\\'s Hyde Park, which drew a record attendance of 150,000. In June 1993, more than 500,000 listeners gathered for his free performance on the Great Lawn of New York\\'s Central Park, while millions more around the world watched on television. The following September, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, he sang for an estimated crowd of 300,000. Following on from the original 1990 concert, the Three Tenors concerts were held during the three subsequent FIFA World Cup Finals, in 1994 in Los Angeles, 1998 in Paris, and 2002 in Yokohama. In September 1995, Pavarotti performed Schubert\\'s Ave Maria along with Dolores O\\'Riordan; Diana, Princess of Wales, who attended the live performance, told O\\'Riordan that the song brought her to tears. In 1995, Pavarotti\\'s friends, the singer Lara Saint Paul (as Lara Cariaggi) and her husband showman Pier Quinto Cariaggi, who had produced and organised Pavarotti\\'s 1990 FIFA World Cup Celebration Concert at the PalaTrussardi in Milan, produced and wrote the television documentary \"The Best is Yet to Come\", an extensive biography about the life of Pavarotti. Lara Saint Paul was the interviewer for the documentary with Pavarotti, who spoke candidly about his life and career. Pavarotti\\'s rise to stardom was not without occasional difficulties, however. He earned a reputation as \"The King of Cancellations\" by frequently backing out of performances, and his unreliable nature led to poor relationships with some opera houses. This was brought into focus in 1989 when Ardis Krainik of the Lyric Opera of Chicago severed the house\\'s 15-year relationship with the tenor. Over an eight-year period, Pavarotti had cancelled 26 out of 41 scheduled appearances at the Lyric, and the decisive move by Krainik to ban him for life was well noted throughout the opera world, after the performer walked away from a season premiere less than two weeks before rehearsals began, saying pain from a sciatic nerve required two months of treatment. On 12 December 1998, he became the first (and, to date, only) opera singer to perform on \"Saturday Night Live\", singing alongside Vanessa L. Williams. He also sang with U2 in the band\\'s 1995 song \"Miss Sarajevo\" and with Mercedes Sosa in a big concert at the Boca Juniors arena La Bombonera in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1999. In 1998, Pavarotti was presented with the Grammy Legend Award. Career: Early 2000s. In 2001, Pavarotti was acquitted in Italian court of a long standing dispute concerning his official country of residency and taxable earnings. Pavarotti long claimed Monte Carlo in the tax haven of Monaco as his official residence, but an Italian court in 1999 had rejected that claim by ruling that his Monaco address could not accommodate his entire family. In 2000 Pavarotti agreed to pay the Italian government more than $7.6 million in back taxes and penalties as a result of tax evasion charges that dated from 1989 to 1995. Pavarotti was subsequently fully acquitted by an Italian court of filing false tax returns in 2001. On 13 December 2003, he married his second wife and former personal assistant, Nicoletta Mantovani (born 1969), with whom he already had another daughter, Alice. Alice\\'s twin brother, Riccardo, was stillborn after complications in January 2003. At the time of his death in September 2007, he was survived by his wife, his four daughters, and one granddaughter. In late 2003, he released his final compilation—and his first and only \"crossover\" album, \"Ti Adoro.\" Most of the 13 songs were written and produced by Michele Centonze, who had already helped produce the \"Pavarotti & Friends\" concerts between 1998 and 2000. The tenor described the album as a wedding gift to Nicoletta Mantovani. That same year he was made a Commander of Monaco\\'s Order of Cultural Merit. In 2004, one of Pavarotti\\'s former managers, Herbert Breslin, published a book, \"The\\xa0King\\xa0&\\xa0I\". Seen by critics as bitter and sensationalistic, it is critical of the singer\\'s acting (in opera), his inability to read music well and learn parts, and his personal conduct, although acknowledging their success together. In an interview in 2005 with Jeremy Paxman on the BBC, Pavarotti rejected the allegation that he could not read music, although he acknowledged he did not read orchestral scores. He received an enormous number of awards and honours, including Kennedy Center Honors in 2001. He also holds two Guinness World Records: one for receiving the most curtain calls (165) and another for the best-selling classical album (\"Carreras Domingo Pavarotti in Concert\" by the Three Tenors; the latter record is thus shared by fellow tenors Plácido Domingo and José Carreras). Final performances and health issues. Pavarotti began his farewell tour in 2004, at the age of 69, performing one last time in old and new locations, after more than four decades on the stage. On 13 March 2004, Pavarotti gave his last performance in an opera at the New York Metropolitan Opera, for which he received a long standing ovation for his role as the painter Mario Cavaradossi in Giacomo Puccini\\'s \"Tosca.\" On 1 December 2004, he announced a 40-city farewell tour. Pavarotti and his manager, Terri Robson, commissioned impresario Harvey Goldsmith to produce the Worldwide Farewell Tour. His last full-scale performance was at the end of a two-month Australasian tour in Taiwan in December 2005. In March 2005, Pavarotti underwent neck surgery to repair two vertebrae. In early 2006, he underwent further back surgery and contracted an infection while in the hospital in New York, forcing cancellation of concerts in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. On 10 February 2006, Pavarotti performed \"Nessun dorma\" at the 2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Turin, Italy, at his final performance. In the last act of the opening ceremony, his performance received the longest and loudest ovation of the night from the international crowd. Leone Magiera, who directed the performance, revealed in his 2008 memoirs, \"Pavarotti Visto da Vicino\", that the performance had been recorded weeks earlier. \"The orchestra pretended to play for the audience, I pretended to conduct and Luciano pretended to sing. The effect was wonderful,\" he wrote. Pavarotti\\'s manager, Terri Robson, said that the tenor had turned the Winter Olympic Committee\\'s invitation down several times because it would have been impossible to sing late at night in the subzero conditions of Turin in February. The committee eventually persuaded him to take part by prerecording the song. Death. While proceeding with an international \"farewell tour\", Pavarotti was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in July 2006. The tenor fought back against the implications of this diagnosis, undergoing major abdominal surgery and making plans for the resumption and conclusion of his singing commitments, but he died at his home in Modena on 6 September 2007. After his death, his manager, Terri Robson, noted in a statement, \"The Maestro fought a long, tough battle against the pancreatic cancer which eventually took his life. In fitting with the approach that characterised his life and work, he remained positive until finally succumbing to the last stages of his illness\". Pavarotti\\'s funeral was held at Modena Cathedral. The then Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Kofi Annan attended. The Frecce Tricolori, the aerobatic demonstration team of the Italian Air Force, flew overhead, leaving green-white-red smoke trails. After a funeral procession through the centre of Modena, Pavarotti\\'s coffin was taken the final to Montale Rangone, a village part of Castelnuovo Rangone, and was interred in the Pavarotti family crypt. The funeral, in its entirety, was also telecast live on CNN. The Vienna State Opera and the Salzburg Festival Hall flew black flags in mourning. Tributes were published by many opera houses, such as London\\'s Royal Opera House. Other work. Film and television. Pavarotti\\'s one venture into film was \"Yes, Giorgio\" (1982), a romantic comedy movie directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, in which he starred as the main character Giorgio Fini. The film was a critical and commercial failure, although it received an Academy Award nomination for Best Music, Original Song. He can be seen to better advantage in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle\\'s movie \"Rigoletto\", an adaptation of the opera of the same name also released in 1982, or in his more than 20 live opera performances taped for television between 1978 and 1994, most of them with the Metropolitan Opera, and most available on DVD. He received two Primetime Emmy Awards for his PBS variety specials \"Pavarotti in Philadelphia: La Boheme\" and \"Duke of Mantua, Rigoletto Great Performances\". \"Pavarotti\", a 2019 documentary film about him, was directed by Ron Howard and produced with the cooperation of Pavarotti\\'s estate using family archives, interviews and live music footage. Humanitarianism. Pavarotti annually hosted the Pavarotti & Friends charity concerts in his home town of Modena Italy, joining with singers from all parts of the music industry, including B.B. King, Andrea Bocelli, Zucchero, Jon Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams, Bono, James Brown, Mariah Carey, Eric Clapton, Dolores O\\'Riordan, Sheryl Crow, Céline Dion, Anastacia, Elton John, Deep Purple, Meat Loaf, Queen, George Michael, Tracy Chapman, the Spice Girls, Sting and Barry White to raise money for several UN causes. Concerts were held for War Child, and victims of war and civil unrest in Bosnia, Guatemala, Kosovo and Iraq. After the war in Bosnia, he financed and established the Pavarotti Music Centre in the southern city of Mostar to offer Bosnia\\'s artists the opportunity to develop their skills. For these contributions, the city of Sarajevo named him an honorary citizen in 2006. He performed at benefit concerts to raise money for victims of tragedies such as the Spitak earthquake that killed 25,000 people in northern Armenia in December 1988, and sang Gounod\\'s \"Ave Maria\" with legendary French pop music star and ethnic Armenian Charles Aznavour. He was a close friend of Diana, Princess of Wales. They raised money for the elimination of land mines worldwide. In 1998, he was appointed the United Nations Messenger of Peace, using his fame to raise awareness of UN issues, including the Millennium Development Goals, HIV/AIDS, child rights, urban slums and poverty. In 1999, Pavarotti performed a charity benefit concert in Beirut, to mark Lebanon\\'s re-emergence on the world stage after a brutal 15-year civil war. The largest concert held in Beirut since the end of the war, it was attended by 20,000 people who travelled from countries as distant as Saudi Arabia and Bulgaria. In 1999 he also hosted a charity benefit concert to build a school in Guatemala, for Guatemalan civil war orphans. It was named after him Centro Educativo Pavarotti. Now the foundation of nobel prize winner Rigoberta Menchú Tum is running the school. In 2001, Pavarotti received the Nansen Medal from the UN High Commission for Refugees for his efforts raising money on behalf of refugees worldwide. Through benefit concerts and volunteer work, he has raised more than any other individual. Also in 2001, Pavarotti was chosen one of that year\\'s five recipients by the President and First Lady as an honoree for their lifetime achievements in the arts at the White House, followed by the Kennedy Center; the Kennedy Center Honors, He was surprised by the appearance of Secretary-General of the United Nations and that year\\'s winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Kofi Annan, who lauded him for his contribution to humankind. Six months prior, Pavarotti had held a large charity concert for Afghan refugees, particularly children in his home town of Modena, Italy. Other honours he received include the \"Freedom of London Award\" and The Red Cross \"Award for Services to Humanity\", for his work in raising money for that organisation, and the 1998 \"MusiCares Person of the Year\", given to humanitarian heroes by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity. Legacy and estate assignment. His first will was opened the day after his death; a second will was opened within the same month of September. He left an estate outside his native Modena (now a museum), a villa in Pesaro, his flat in Monte Carlo, and three flats in New York City. Pavarotti\\'s widow\\'s lawyers, Giorgio Bernini and Anna Maria Bernini, and manager Terri Robson announced on 30 June 2008 that his family amicably settled his estate—€300 million ($474.2 million, including $15 million in U.S. assets). Pavarotti drafted two wills before his death: one divided his assets by Italian law, giving half to his second wife, Nicoletta Mantovani, and half to his four daughters; the second gave his U.S. holdings to Mantovani. The judge confirmed the compromise by the end of July 2008. However, a Pesaro public prosecutor, Massimo di Patria, investigated allegations that Pavarotti was not of sound mind when he signed the will. Pavarotti\\'s estate has been settled \"fairly\", a lawyer for Mantovani said in statements after reports of a dispute between her and his three daughters from his first marriage. He posthumously received the Italy-USA Foundation\\'s America Award in 2013 and the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2014. Selected discography. In addition to his very large discography of opera performances Pavarotti also made many classical crossover and pop recordings, the Pavarotti & Friends series of concerts and, for Decca, a series of studio recital albums: first six albums of opera arias and then, from 1979, six albums of Italian song. Awards and honors. Grammy Awards. The Grammy Awards are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.',\n",
       " 'The German General Staff, originally the Prussian General Staff and officially the Great General Staff , was a full-time body at the head of the Prussian Army and later, the German Army, responsible for the continuous study of all aspects of war, and for drawing up and reviewing plans for mobilization or campaign. It existed unofficially from 1806, and was formally established by law in 1814, the first general staff in existence. It was distinguished by the formal selection of its officers by intelligence and proven merit rather than patronage or wealth, and by the exhaustive and rigorously structured training which its staff officers undertook. The Prussian General Staff also enjoyed greater freedom from political control than its contemporaries, and this autonomy was enshrined in law on the unification of Germany and the establishment of the German Empire in 1871. It came to be regarded as the home of German militarism in the aftermath of World War I, and the victorious Allies attempted to suppress the institution. It nevertheless survived to play its accustomed part in the German rearmament and World War II. In a broader sense, the Prussian General Staff corps consisted of those officers qualified to perform staff duties, and formed a unique military fraternity. Their exhaustive training was designed not only to weed out the less motivated or less able candidates, but also to produce a body of professional military experts with common methods and outlook. General Staff–qualified officers alternated between line and staff duties but remained lifelong members of this special organization. Until the end of the German Empire, social and political convention often placed members of noble or royal households in command of its armies or corps but the actual responsibility for the planning and conduct of operations lay with the formation\\'s staff officers. For other European armies which lacked this professionally trained staff corps, the same conventions were often a recipe for disaster. Even the Army of the Second French Empire, whose senior officers had supposedly reached high rank as a result of bravery and success on the battlefield, was crushed by the Prussian and other German armies during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871. That outcome highlighted poor French administration and planning, and lack of professional education. The chief of staff of a Prussian formation in the field had the right to disagree, in writing, with the plans or orders of the commander of the formation, and appeal to the commander of the next highest formation (which might ultimately be the king, or emperor, who would be guided by the head of the Great General Staff). This served as a check on incompetence and also served for the objecting officer to officially disassociate himself from a flawed plan. Only the most stubborn commanders would not give way before this threat. For these reasons, Prussian and German military victories were often credited professionally to the chief of staff, rather than to the nominal commander of an army. Often the commander of an army was himself a member of the General Staff, but it was now institutionally recognized that not only was command leadership important, but effective staff work was a significant key to success in both pre-war planning and in wartime operations. History. Early history. Before the nineteenth century, success on the battlefield largely depended on the military competence of the sovereign. Duke Frederick William introduced the term \"Generalstabsdienst\" (General Staff Service) for the Prusso-Brandenburgian army in 1640. While Frederick the Great brought success to the Prussian arms, his successors lacked his talent, so generalship in the Army declined, even though they were assisted by a Quartermaster General Staff of adjutants and engineers established by Frederick the Great. Reformers in the army began to write and lecture on the need to preserve and somehow institutionalize the military talent that Frederick had assembled in his army. They argued that a carefully assembled cadre of talented officer staff could plan logistics and train the Army in peace as well as in war. In the last years of the eighteenth century, it became the practice to assign military experts to assist the generals of Prussia\\'s Army, largely at the instigation of comparatively junior but gifted officers such as Gerhard von Scharnhorst and August von Gneisenau. Nevertheless, such measures were insufficient to overcome the inefficiency of the Army, which was commanded by aged veterans of the campaigns of Frederick the Great, almost half a century earlier. In 1806, the Prussian Army was routed by French Armies led by Napoleon\\'s marshals at the Battle of Jena. In the aftermath of this debacle, the Prussian Army and state largely collapsed. \"Seldom in history has an army been reduced to impotence more swiftly or decisively.\" After the Peace of Tilsit in 1807, King Frederick William III appointed Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Prime Minister Baron vom und zum Stein and several promising young officers to his Military Reorganization Commission. This commission acted as a general staff to plan and implement the reconstruction of the Prussian Army. They persuaded the king that to match the French commanders, who rose by merit, each Prussian commander of an Army, Corps and Division should have a staff-trained officer assigned as his adjutant. Scharnhorst intended them to \"support incompetent Generals, providing the talents that might otherwise be wanting among leaders and commanders\". The unlikely pairing of the erratic but popular Field Marshal Blücher as commander in chief with Lieutenant General Gneisenau as his chief of staff showed this system to its best advantage: Blücher lauded Gneisenau for his role in maneuvering the Prussian Army during a difficult retreat through the Harz mountains. Gneisenau is recognized as the first \"great Chief of Staff\". He institutionalized the right of the commander\\'s adviser to take part in command and control by advising the commander until he makes a decision. Gneisenau also founded mission tactics (\"Auftragstaktik\"), in which the commander determines the objective of an operation and allocates the forces used, while the subordinate on the spot determines how the objective will be attained. In 1816, the reformer Karl von Grolman organised the Staff into Eastern (Russia), Southern (Austria), and Western (France and the other German states) Divisions. Sixteen staff officers served in the Prussian Ministry of War and six staff officers worked in the main embassies. Each army corps had one chief of staff and two other staff officers. In 1821 the Quartermaster General Staff was renamed to the General Staff, and its officers were identified by distinctive uniform markings, including a crimson trouser stripe. Staff positions did not depend on lineage. \"General von Krauseneck, who was the Chief of the General Staff from 1829 to 1848, was the son of a Brandenburg organ player and had been promoted from the ranks. General von Rheyer, Chief of the Prussian General Staff from 1848 to 1857 was a shepherd in his youth.\" The General Staff continually planned for likely and unlikely scenarios. In 1843, when Europe had been largely at peace for nearly thirty years and most major nations had no plans for war, observers noted sheaves of orders at the Prussian War Ministry, already made out to cover all foreseeable contingencies and requiring only a signature and a date stamp to be put into effect. Selection and education of staff officers. The Military Reorganization Commission opened military schools in Königsberg and Breslau. On 15 October 1810 Scharnhorst opened the General War School (\"Allgemeine Kriegsschule\"), on the same day that the new University of Berlin opened nearby. The General War School trained selected officers for three years. One of its first directors was Carl von Clausewitz, who served until 1830. His monumental work On War (\"Vom Kriege\") was published posthumously. From his studies and experiences during the Napoleonic Wars, he wrote a syllabus which became the staff\\'s central doctrine. This standardization of doctrine which was an attempt to grasp the philosophy underlying warfare, rather than setting a narrow set of rules such as those laid down by Antoine-Henri Jomini was one of the distinguishing features of the Prussian General Staff. Every General Staff officer had to be able, at any time, to take over the work of another and apply to it the same body of basic ideas and the same principles of operational and tactical thought. On October 1, 1859, the General War School was renamed the War Academy (\"Kriegsakademie\"), which was supervised by the Inspector-General of Military Education. Students at the War Academy attended about 20 hours of lectures per week. Instruction was by professors from Berlin University and officers serving on the Great General Staff, who thereby enhanced their own educations. In 1872 the War Academy was taken from the Inspector of Military Education and placed under the Chief of the General Staff. The spirit of the academy was articulated by Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke, who emphasized the importance \"of an active process of mental give and take between teacher and pupils, so as to stimulate the pupils to become fellow-workers\". Admission to the academy was highly selective. Officers with at least five years service who wanted to become General Staff officers prepared themselves for the entrance examination, which included tactics, surveying, geography, mathematics and French, with questions set to test understanding rather than rote memory. The graders of the essays did not know the names or regiments of the candidates. From hundreds of applicants, about one hundred were accepted every year to enter the first-year course at the academy. Those who performed satisfactorily were promoted to the second and then the third year. In the first year, fourteen hours of lectures each week were on military subjects, including military history, while seventeen hours were non-military, which included general history, mathematics, science and a choice of French or Russian. Roughly the same time allocations were used in the last two years. Lectures were supplemented by visits to fortifications, arms factories and exercises of the railway regiment. During the three month summer breaks the students attended manoeuvres and were taken on field tactical exercises in which they commanded imaginary units. At the end of the course they took their second examination. Only about thirty students passed this extremely difficult test. They were then assigned (\"kommandiert\") to the Great General Staff, while retaining their regimental attachments. After two years they took their third and final examination, after which five to eight officers were permanently posted to fill vacancies in the General Staff a remarkable winnowing from the many who had entered the competition. Occasionally, an exceptional officer was appointed without this training: for example Max Bauer, who was trained as an artilleryman, became a prominent member of the Great General Staff, with the reputation of being the smartest man in the army. Some graduates were not enthusiastic about the first year of their training. For example, Paul von Hindenburg thought that the history of ancient battles should be minimized to give more time to modern, and that trigonometry was only useful to those who would be surveyors. The final two years satisfied him. While at the academy he was invited into the social circle of Prince Alexander of Prussia, where he came \"in touch with men of science as well as those in the state and court service. After its defeat in the war against Prussia of 1866, Bavaria established its own War Academy and continued to train its own staff officers after the foundation of the German Empire in 1870. Size of the staff. The General Staff of that time was a small, elite body, numbering as few as fifty officers and rarely exceeding one hundred officers. Only one or two officers were permanently assigned to the General Staff, described in official returns as \"des Generalstabs\" (\"of the General Staff\") at any time; most were attached to the General Staff while remaining affiliated to their parent regiments, usually for several years at a time, and were listed as \"\" (\"on the General Staff\"). When the General Staff was required to take the field during major campaigns, it remained a small but effective body. During the Franco-Prussian War for example, the staff that accompanied the headquarters of the King (as commander-in-chief) and was responsible for the direction of armies that totaled 850,000 men, consisted of the chief of staff, a quartermaster-general and an intendant-general whose duties were not directly concerned with military operations, three heads of departments, eleven other officers, ten draughtsmen, seven clerks and fifty-nine other ranks (orderlies, messengers, etc.). Nor was there ever a large pool of officers to draw upon to perform General Staff duties. In 1871, there were only 375 officers fully qualified to serve on the General Staff, even after an emergency expansion during the Franco-Prussian War. In 1914, there were 625 General Staff-qualified officers for armies which had almost doubled in size since 1871. Moltke the Elder. In 1857, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, a widely travelled officer who was a confidante of King William I, was appointed Chief of the General Staff. Under his control, the existing staff system was expanded and consolidated. Each year, Moltke selected the best twelve graduates from the \"Kriegsakademie\" for his personal training as General Staff officers. They attended theoretical studies, annual manoeuvres, \"war rides\" (a system of tactical exercises without troops in the field) under Moltke himself, and war games and map exercises known as \"Kriegsspiele\". Although these officers subsequently alternated between regimental and staff duties, they could be relied upon to think and act exactly as Moltke had taught them when they became the Chiefs of Staff of major formations. Moltke himself referred to them as the \"nervous system\" of the Prussian Army. In the victories which the Prussian Army was to gain against Austrian Empire and France, Moltke needed only to issue brief directives expressing his intentions to the main formations, leaving the staffs at the subordinate headquarters to implement the details according to the doctrines and methods he had laid down, while the Supreme Commands of his opponents became bogged down in mountains of paperwork and trivia as they tried to control the entire army from a single overworked headquarters. Moltke\\'s wide experience also prompted the General Staff to consider fields of study outside the purely military, and rapidly adapt them to military use. Immediately upon his appointment, he established the \"Abteilung\" (section or department) which studied and promoted the development of railway networks within Prussia and incorporated them into its deployment plans. He also formed telegraphic, and other scientific and technical departments within the General Staff and a Historical division, which analysed past and current conflicts and published accounts of them and lessons learned. The General Staff reformed by Moltke was the most effective in Europe, an autonomous institution dedicated solely to the efficient execution of war, unlike in other countries, whose staffs were often fettered by meddling courtiers, parliaments and government officials. On the contrary, the General Staff itself had a powerful effect on Prussian, and later German, politics. War with Denmark. The Second Schleswig War (1864), the political origins of which lay in Denmark\\'s conflict with Prussia and Austria over the Schleswig–Holstein question, vindicated Moltke\\'s concepts of operations and led to an overhaul of the command arrangements of the Prussian Army. Moltke envisaged a rapid attack to prevent the Danes falling back behind water obstacles which the Prussian Navy could not overcome. A rigid system of seniority placed Friedrich Graf von Wrangel, widely regarded as being in his dotage, in command. He ignored all of Moltke\\'s directives and his own staff\\'s advice, and by allowing the Danish Army to withdraw at its leisure he prolonged the war for several months. The resulting \"post mortem\" was to ensure a better (though not infallible) system for appointing commanders. Seven Weeks\\' War. The Austro-Prussian War (1866) became almost inevitable after the end of hostilities with Denmark. Many Prussians regarded the war as a sad necessity. Moltke, describing his reasons for confidence to War Minister Albrecht von Roon, stated \"We have the inestimable advantage of being able to carry our Field Army of 285,000 men over five railway lines and of virtually concentrating them in twenty-five days ... Austria has only one railway line and it will take her forty-five days to assemble 200,000 men.\" Although there were inevitable mistakes and confusion on the battlefield, Moltke\\'s pre-war calculations were proved correct, and the Austrian army was brought to battle at Königgrätz and destroyed. In contrast to the Prussian staff, Austrian staff officers gained their posts either by membership of the Austrian nobility and a desire to avoid tedious regimental duties, or after uninspiring training which made them into plodding, rule-bound clerks. In all aspects of preparation, planning and execution, their muddled efforts compared badly with that of their Prussian counterparts. Prussian staff analysis and army improvements. In reviewing Prussian deficiencies against the Austrians, the General Staff made several improvements to increase the strategic and tactical proficiency of the King\\'s army. Cavalry would no longer be held in reserve, but would actively screen the army\\'s movements at all levels, make first contact with the enemy, and constantly observe hostile activities. Newly developed rifled artillery would no longer be placed in the rear of the order of march for employment behind the infantry; instead, a significant detachment would travel with the advanced guard of the leading corps or other major element, and the remainder would march with the front of the main body, providing immediate artillery coverage of the advanced guard on contact and of the main body during subsequent deployment on the field. A renewed emphasis was placed on maintaining contact with subordinate and superior commands, so that commanders always were informed of units\\' locations on the battlefield, reducing the \"fog of war\" effect. Finally, the introduction of the breech-loading infantry rifle marked a revolution in weapons effect, so that Moltke made the following analysis in 1865: The attack of a position is becoming notably more difficult than its defense. The defensive during the first phase of battle offers a decisive superiority. The task of a skillful offensive will consist of forcing our foe to attack a position chosen by us, and only when casualties, demoralization, and exhaustion have drained his strength will we ourselves take up the tactical offensive... Our strategy must be offensive, our tactics defensive. Franco-Prussian War. The government of Napoleon III was undoubtedly startled by the Prussian victory over Austria, and urgently sought to reform their army to face the conflict with Prussia which seemed inevitable and imminent. Their senior officers entirely failed to grasp the methods of the Prussian General Staff. The Chief of Staff of the French Army, \"Maréchal de France\" Edmond Le Bœuf, fatuously stated in 1870 that the French Army was ready for war, \"down to the last gaiter button.\" In the event, at the outset of the Franco-Prussian War, 462,000 German soldiers concentrated flawlessly on the French frontier while only 270,000 French soldiers could be moved to face them, the French army having lost 100,000 stragglers before a shot was fired through poor planning and administration. (Most of these were reservists who had not been able to join their units before the units were hastily dispatched to join the armies forming up near the frontier.) During the war, there were again the inevitable mistakes due to the \"fog of war\", but German formations moved with a speed and precision which French staff officers, accustomed only to moving battalion-sized punitive columns, could not match. In the French army of the time, there was an anti-intellectual prejudice in favour of brave and unimaginative regimental officers over intelligent and well-trained staff officers. The French Army paid dearly for this bias in 1870 and 1871. The result of the strategic preparation by Moltke (and diplomatic maneuvers by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck) was complete Prussian victory. After the victory, Germany was unified as the Prussia-dominated German Empire; King Wilhelm I of Prussia was proclaimed \"German Emperor\" on 18 January 1871. The German victory surprised many military professionals around the world. France had been considered a great military power while Prussia was widely considered a lesser power, despite its military successes in 1813-1815 against Napoleon and more recently over Austria during the Seven Weeks\\' War of 1866. Many nations adopted Prussian staff methods and structures, with mixed success. Throughout his tenure, Moltke pushed for the Prussian army to engage in reassessment and self-improvement at every command level to maintain tactical superiority relative to other nations. Moltke formalised the concept of mission-type tactics, which emphasized the importance of initiative at all levels of command, even the lowest. Every Prussian tactical manual published after the Franco-Prussian War included this passage: A favorable situation will never be exploited if commanders wait for orders. The highest commander and the youngest soldier must always be conscious of the fact that omission and inactivity are worse than resorting to the wrong expedient. From unification to World War I. With unification the Prussian General Staff became the Imperial German General Staff, with seconded general staff officers from Saxony, Württemberg and Bavaria, and was responsible for military planning for the German Empire. They began preparing for what seemed to be another inevitable war with France, which was intent on revenge and recovery of the provinces annexed by Germany. Bismarck\\'s diplomatic skill had prevented any hostile European coalition forming against Germany, but the young Kaiser William II replaced him in 1890 and turned away from their friendly accommodation with Russia in favor of an alliance with Austria-Hungary. Before long France and Russia allied. Therefore, encircled Germany faced the possibility of war on both Eastern and Western fronts. To meet this threat, Chief of Staff Alfred von Schlieffen and his successor, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, drew up and continually refined the Schlieffen Plan to meet this eventuality. The Plan committed Germany to an early offensive against France while Russia was still mobilising and also required the invasion of neutral Belgium. In Bismarck\\'s German constitution the kaiser commanded the army and also appointed the chancellor and his cabinet, who had no control of the military. The elected representatives in the Reichstag were needed to pass budgets, but aside from this had no power over the conduct of the government. This was one of the seeds of the mass destruction of the First World War, as military planning was not subject to political control. Thus, the Schlieffen Plan was adopted without political input, even though it required the violation of the neutrality of Belgium, which the Germans had guaranteed by treaty. Nor was the German Navy\\'s high command informed. It failed to take adequate account of logistics and the inability of horse-drawn transport to supply troops far from rail-heads. The plan has been accused of being too rigid. The philosopher Manuel de Landa argues that the Prussian army now favored the Jominian theory, which gave preeminence to the Army and to its autonomy, compared to the civilian control advocated by Clausewitz. To an extent, the General Staff became obsessed with perfecting the methods which had gained victory in the late nineteenth century. Although he maintained an icy formal demeanor, Moltke the Elder had been a flexible and innovative thinker in many fields. Schlieffen, by comparison, was a single-minded, brilliant military specialist. Nor had the General Staff, before the war, considered the use of potential allies such as Turkey, or dissident factions within the French, British and Russian empires, to distract or weaken the Allied war effort. \"A swift victory over the main armies in the main theatre of war was the German General Staff\\'s solution for all outside difficulties, and absolved them from thinking of war in its wider aspects.\" The General Staff mistakenly predicted that China would win the First Sino-Japanese War. Organization. The General Staff was divided between the central \"Großer Generalstab\" in Berlin and the general staffs of the corps and division HQs. The head of the \"Großer Generalstab\" was the \"Chief of the General Staff\" and was also the technical superior of all general staff officers. The Chief of the General Staff\\'s chief deputy held the title of \"Generalquartiermeister\". Beneath them were the five \"Oberquartiermeisters\", who supervised the heads of the General Staff departments. The Railroad Department had the largest number of officers assigned, while the Second Department was the most important. World War I. In August 1914, following the pre-war mobilization plan, most of the General Staff, including the \"Oberquartiermeisters\", were reassigned to the headquarters of the Armies and Corps. The remaining core became the \"General Staff of the Field Army\", part of the \"Oberste Heeresleitung\" (OHL, Supreme Army Command). The General Staff was streamlined into only three departments; Operations, Intelligence and Political Affairs. The need for the system was promptly demonstrated when Supreme Commander Kaiser Wilhelm II proposed to concentrate against Russia, not France. Chief of the General Staff Helmuth von Moltke the Younger and Generalquartiermeister, Hermann von Stein convinced him that this was unthinkable because the thousands of orders could be quickly rewritten and because the French with their quicker mobilization and excellent railways would be attacking a German border in force long before the Russians. One of the eight German Armies was commanded by Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, paired with Konstantin Schmidt von Knobelsdorf, a senior general staff officer the kaiser instructed his thirty-two-year-old son: \"whatever he advises you must do\". The system also removed uncertainty about the competence of Army Commanders Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria and Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg, though both were well-trained soldiers. Other armies were commanded by highly experienced staff officers, for example Paul von Hindenburg was given command of the Eighth Army, the only one facing the Russians invading East Prussia, with Erich Ludendorff as chief of staff. The interactions between a commander and his chief of staff were elucidated by a successful practitioner of both roles, Hans von Seeckt The decision is taken in private, and when the two men come out, there is only one decision. They have amalgamated it; they share one mind with each other. Should the opinions have differed, in the evening of this happy day in a military marriage the two halves will no longer know who gave in. The outside world and military history will not have knowledge of a domestic quarrel. The competence of command and control is based on this fusion of the two personalities. It does not matter if the order bears the commander\\'s signature, or if the Chief of Staff has signed it for the High Command (today \\'For the commander\\') according to our old custom. The commander always issues his orders through his Chief of Staff, and even the most senior subordinate leader must submit himself to his orders without objection, because his orders will always be given on behalf of the supreme commander. The Schlieffen Plan was scuttled when the shaken Moltke ordered the German right wing in France to retire during the First Battle of the Marne. Soon Moltke was replaced by Erich von Falkenhayn who was already the Prussian war minister. After failing to dislodge the Entente in Flanders, he put the Western Front on the defensive. He was replaced at the war ministry in early 1915, and in 1916 Hindenburg and Ludendorff took over as advisers to the supreme commander. They led \"OHL\" in aggressively intervening in German political and economic life, changing the original goal of defending Germany\\'s borders to conquest and expansion. A consequence of wartime attrition was the premature deployment of \"Kriegsakademie\" students to army and corps general staffs, some of them before reaching their second year curriculum. Later, standards for General Staff assignment were altered due to the closure of the \"Kriegsakademie\", to allow examined officers to serve as staff apprentices, raising concerns that these new General Staff Corps officers were not evaluated or trained at the level of those they were replacing. Superior German staff work at division, corps and army level throughout the war was a major contributor to their run of successes. At the beginning of 1918 having defeated the Russians Hindenburg and Ludendorff resolved to win in the west. Tactically, their staff work was brilliant. Using only weapons that had failed at Verdun, they devised a long, comprehensive list of measures to smash through enemy field fortifications, which were then taught to all ranks in the attacking units. The German Army had tactical success during the Spring Offensive, but the Allies held strategic points. They were sure that a series of successful breakthroughs would snap their enemy\\'s resolve, ignoring the fact that each victory sapped German strength, while their foes were continually strengthened by Americans flooding into France. The Germans were overwhelmed during the Hundred Days Offensive, and eventually agreed to an Armistice of 11 November 1918 with the Allies. Interwar period. The victors\\' fear was encapsulated by the clause in the Treaty of Versailles: \"The Great German General Staff and all similar organisations shall be dissolved and may not be reconstituted in any form.\" The German Army was limited to 4,000 officers. The Weimar Republics armed forces, the Reichswehr, was led by Hans von Seeckt. He camouflaged the General Staff by renaming it the \"Truppenamt\" (\"troop office\"), and selected many General Staff officers to fill the available places. The War Academy (\"Kriegsakademie\") was abolished, but training of General Staff officers continued, dispersed among the \"Wehrkreise\" (Military District) headquarters but overseen by tutors from the \"Truppenamt\". General Staff officers continued to play major roles in the nation, most strikingly when former chief of staff Paul von Hindenburg was elected Reichspräsident in 1925. When Adolf Hitler became Reichskanzler in 1933, he instructed the Truppenamt/General Staff to ignore the Versailles restrictions; he would create a greatly expanded Wehrmacht, including the Army, the Navy, and a new Air Force. A new War Academy (\"Kriegsakademie\") was established in 1935. The General Staff advised Hitler that the Army could not be fully modernized until 1944 or 1945. When Hitler went to war in 1939, the tank columns were still followed by horse-drawn artillery pieces. Throughout the war, German industry was unable to furnish small arms in sufficient quantities, forcing the Army to rely heavily on older weapons, prizes of war, and adaptations of former designs produced in conquered countries, thus producing an arsenal filled with an array of incompatible pieces, unlike the smaller variety of standard small arms used by the Allies. Initially, the Army\\'s leaders feared that their leading role as the defenders of Germany would be usurped by the unruly SA, the Nazi party\\'s political militia. When Hitler suppressed the SA in the Night of the Long Knives, the army stood aside and effectually acquiesced in the extrajudicial murders involved, including those of army officers. While the General Staff welcomed Hitler\\'s expansion of the army, they were opposed to many of his wilder schemes and continually urged caution. When several of Hitler\\'s early moves such as the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the Anschluss with Austria and the occupation of the Sudetenland succeeded despite advice from the General Staff that these might bring about a premature war with France and Britain, Hitler was further convinced that his intuition was superior to the General Staff\\'s intellectual analysis. When Hindenburg died, the Army replaced their oath to the constitution with one to the Führer Adolf Hitler. Hitler was soon able to curtail the Army\\'s traditional independence, by the fortuitous disgrace of the commander in chief of the armed forces, Werner von Blomberg, and false accusations of homosexuality against the commander in chief of the army, Werner von Fritsch. (The combined scandals were known as the Blomberg–Fritsch affair.) The armed forces command structure was changed by Hitler in 1938, with an Armed Forces HQ (the \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\", usually contracted to \"OKW\") placed over the army command (\"Oberkommando des Heeres\" or \"OKH\") and the other service commands, and almost entirely displacing the Reich War Ministry. However, OKW from its inception had generally weaker, more pliant staff officers than OKH and the Luftwaffe. A weakness of both the \"Kriegsakademie\" curriculum and General Staff doctrine was that it focused primarily on tactical and operational matters. There was no institution comparable to the United States National War College or the British Imperial Defence College where higher-ranking officers of all services could study wider economic, political and diplomatic issues related to broad strategy. Since commanders were no longer selected by pedigree, the chiefs of staff were no longer joint commanders. Their role was The commander must be supported by obedient, independent and critical advising General Staff officers (\"Fuehrergehilfen\"). They provide him with information and advice, prepare decisions, turn them into orders and measures and supervise their execution. If necessary, they urge the commander to decide and act. Their thinking and actions must be guided by his will and intentions and must be determined by his decisions and orders. World War II. Towards the end of the War of 1914 to 1918, the General Staff had almost wholly usurped the political power of the state. At the beginning of World War II, by contrast, its influence was less than it had been at the outset of the First World War and actually declined during the war. In part this was due to the increasing pre-eminence of the other branches of the German armed forces, in particular of the \"Luftwaffe\". The commander in chief of the \"Luftwaffe\", Hitler\\'s friend and political colleague Hermann Göring, always had personal influence with Hitler which no Army leader had. Another was the increasing tension between OKH and OKW. While the need for a joint headquarters to coordinate the work of all the services was desirable in theory, for example to determine industrial and manpower priorities and avoid duplication of effort, OKW was increasingly used as an alternate Army planning staff by Hitler. At the same time, OKW failed in its task of overseeing the overall war effort, resulting in wasteful diversion of resources to several competing and unregulated forces (such as the SS) responsible only to themselves or to Hitler alone. After 1941, OKH was largely responsible for operations on the Eastern Front only (and administration of the army as a whole), while OKW directed operations on the other fronts. There were now effectively two general staffs, often competing with each other, with arbitration of all disputes in the hands of Hitler, further increasing his personal power. Finally, in late 1941, Hitler dismissed Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, the commander in chief of the Army, and assumed direct command of the Army himself. From this time onwards, neither OKW nor OKH could independently plan or conduct operations, but merely implemented Hitler\\'s often flawed commands. At a lower level, training of General Staff officers continued, but the course was still almost as long, intense, and exclusive as in peacetime. Properly-trained staff officers became increasingly scarce, and in some cases newly qualified staff officers lacked the dedication or moral courage of their predecessors. 20 July plot. Before and during the early part of the war, some General Staff officers, notably the Chief, Franz Halder, considered a coup d\\'état to remove Hitler from power, and avoid what they believed would be a disastrous and premature war. They planned a coup as response to Hitler ordering war on Czechoslovakia to seize the Sudetenland, when Britain and France were opposed. But France and Britain capitulated at Munich, which removed the danger of war and justified Hitler\\'s policy; the dissidents let the matter drop. In November 1939, Halder, still fearing the war would end in disaster, discussed a coup with Army C-in-C von Brauchitsch and Carl Goerdeler of the Schwarze Kapelle, but finally decided Hitler was untouchable until Germany met a \"setback\". Opposition to Hitler nevertheless continued, including among the General Staff officers of the \"Ersatzheer\" (\"Replacement Army\"), which had charge of all new troops being organized in Germany for the field army. They set up \"Operation Valkyrie\", in which \"Ersatzheer\" detachments would take control of Germany. On 20 July 1944, the conspirators tried to kill Hitler, thought they had succeeded, and initiated \"Valkyrie\". But most line officers and the bulk of the General Staff refused to obey the \"Valkyrie\" plotters; when Hitler was known to be alive, the coup collapsed entirely. However, many General Staff officers were clearly implicated in the plot, and the General Staff was revealed as a center of dissent. In the months after 20 July, several dozen General Staff officers were arrested and in most cases executed. Also, Luftwaffe, SS, or \"National Socialist Leadership Officers\" were appointed to positions normally occupied by General Staff officers in new or rebuilt formations. Bundeswehr. On May 15, 1957, the first chief of staff of the \"Bundeswehr\", General Heusinger, spoke at the opening of the new Army Academy (\"Heeresakademie\"), pointing out that General Staff officers are \"the defenders and guardians of the values of German military tradition\", extending back 147 years. German students are admitted to the Army Academy after studying at a Federal Armed Forces University (\"Universität der Bundeswehr\") in Hamburg or Munich, followed by several years of line duty. Officers from other NATO countries are their classmates. The academy also teaches a 10-month Army General Staff Officer Course for officers from non-NATO countries. In the \"Bundeswehr\" there are General Staff officers, but no General Staff officer branch or corps. The chief of staff of the Federal Armed Forces is the supreme military representative of the \"Bundeswehr\" and the principal military adviser to the Government. In the event of war the Federal Republic of Germany is the only NATO country which immediately relinquishes operational command over all combat units of her armed forces to NATO commanders. Hence the \"Bundeswehr\" does no operational defense planning, which was the classic task of former German General Staffs. Therefore, the role of the General Staff officer is as the adviser to an operational commander, \"his main task is to advise his commander in all matters, and he is entitled to the commander\\'s attention\". Most General Staff officers are graduates of the Federal Armed Forces Command and General Staff Academy (\"Führungsakademie\") in Hamburg. General Staff officers are rotated through line commands to keep them familiar with everyday unit problems. General Staff officers are identified by crimson facings on their uniforms and by inserting \"i. G.\" (\"im Generalstabsdienst\") after their rank. Less than four per cent of officers are members of the General Staff. There are five General Staff officers in each \"Bundeswehr\" division. At the headquarters of Allied Forces Central Europe in Brunssum Netherlands there are roughly one hundred German officers, but only seventeen are General Staff officers. The \"Bundeswehr\" retains the German army\\'s tradition of mission-oriented command and control (\"Auftragstaktik\"). Moreover, \"lower-rank officers are frequently superiors of higher-rank officers\". Leadership. † denotes people who died in office.',\n",
       " 'The Catuvellauni (Common Brittonic: *\"Catu-wellaunī\", \"war-chiefs\") were a Celtic tribe or state of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, attested by inscriptions into the 4th century. The fortunes of the Catuvellauni and their kings before the conquest can be traced through ancient coins and scattered references in classical histories. They are mentioned by Cassius Dio, who implies that they led the resistance against the conquest in AD 43. They appear as one of the \"civitates\" of Roman Britain in Ptolemy\\'s \"Geography\" in the 2nd century, occupying the town of Verlamion (modern St Albans) and the surrounding areas of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and southern Cambridgeshire. Their territory was bordered to the north by the Iceni and Corieltauvi, to the east by the Trinovantes, to the west by the Dobunni and Atrebates, and to the south by the Regni and Cantiaci. Name. The name \\'Catuvellauni\\' (Common Brittonic: *\"Catu-wellaunī/Catu-uellaunī\", \\'war-chiefs, chiefs-of-war\\') stems from the Celtic root \"catu-\" (\\'combat\\') attached to \"uellauni/wellauni\" (\\'chiefs, commandants\\'). It is probably related to the name of the \\'Catalauni\\', a Belgic tribe dwelling in the modern Champagne region during the Roman period. Before the Roman conquest. The Catuvellauni are part of the Aylesford-Swarling archaeological group in Southern England often linked to Belgic Gaul and possibly to an actual Belgic conquest of the region alluded to by Caesar. John T. Koch conjectures that the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains and the modern name of Châlons-en-Champagne preserves the name of an original continental tribe of Catuvellauni, a name he derives from a compound of the ancient Celtic roots *\"katu-\" (\"battle\") and *\"wer-lo\" (\"better\"), thus meaning \"excelling in battle\", the same source as that of the later British and Breton personal name Cadwallon. Cassivellaunus, who led the resistance to Julius Caesar\\'s first expedition to Britain in 54 BC, is often taken to have belonged to the Catuvellauni. His tribal background is not mentioned by Caesar, but his territory, north of the Thames and to the west of the Trinovantes, corresponds to that later occupied by the Catuvellauni. The extensive earthworks at Devil\\'s Dyke near Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire are thought to have been the tribe\\'s original capital. Tasciovanus was the first king to mint coins at Verlamion, beginning ca 20 BC. He appears to have expanded his power at the expense of the Trinovantes to the east, as some of his coins, ca 15–10 BC, were minted in their capital Camulodunum (modern Colchester). This advance was given up, possibly under pressure from Rome, and a later series of coins were again minted at Verulamium. However, Camulodunum was retaken, either by Tasciovanus or by his son Cunobelinus, who succeeded him ca AD 9 and ruled for about 30 years. Little is known of Cunobelinus\\'s life, but his name survived into British legend, culminating in William Shakespeare\\'s play \"Cymbeline\". Geoffrey of Monmouth says he was brought up at the court of Augustus and willingly paid tribute to Rome. Archaeology indicates increased trading and diplomatic links with the Roman Empire. Under Cunobelinus and his family, the Catuvellauni appear to have become the dominant power in south-eastern Britain. His brother Epaticcus gained territory to the south and west at the expense of the Atrebates until his death ca AD 35. The grave of the \"Druid of Colchester\" dates to this period, providing evidence of medical practices and technology within the Catuvellauni tribe. Three sons of Cunobelinus are known to history. Adminius, whose power-base appears from his coins to have been in Kent, was exiled by his father shortly before AD 40 according to Suetonius, prompting the emperor Caligula to mount his abortive invasion of Britain. Two other sons, Togodumnus and Caratacus, are named by Dio Cassius. No coins of Togodumnus are known, but Caratacus\\'s rare coins suggest that he followed his uncle Epaticcus in completing the conquest of the lands of the Atrebates. It was the exile of the Atrebatic king, Verica, that prompted Claudius to launch a successful invasion, led by Aulus Plautius, in AD 43. Dio tells us that, by this stage, Cunobelinus was dead, and Togodumnus and Caratacus led the initial resistance to the invasion in Kent. They were defeated by Plautius in two crucial battles on the rivers Medway (see Battle of the Medway) and Thames. He also tells us that the Bodunni, a tribe or kingdom who were tributary to the Catuvellauni, switched sides. This may be a misspelling of the Dobunni, who lived in Gloucestershire, and may give an indication of how far Catuvellaunian power extended. Togodumnus died shortly after the battle on the Thames. Plautius halted and sent word for the emperor to join him, and Claudius led the final advance to Camulodunum. The territories of the Catuvellauni became the nucleus of the new Roman province. Under Roman rule. Caratacus, however, had survived, and continued to lead the resistance to the invaders. We next hear of him in Tacitus\\'s \"Annals\", leading the Silures and Ordovices in what is now Wales against the Roman governor Publius Ostorius Scapula. Ostorius defeated him in a set-piece battle somewhere in Ordovician territory in AD 51, capturing members of his family, but Caratacus again escaped. He fled north to the Brigantes, but their queen, Cartimandua, was loyal to the Romans and handed him over in chains. Caratacus was exhibited as a war-prize as part of a triumphal parade in Rome. He was allowed to make a speech to the Senate, and made such an impression that he and his family were freed and allowed to live in peace in Rome. Verulamium, the Roman settlement near Verlamion, gained the status of \"municipium\" ca 50, allowing its leading magistrates to become Roman citizens. It was destroyed in the rebellion of Boudica in 60 or 61, but was soon rebuilt. Its forum and basilica were completed in 79 or 81, and were dedicated in an inscription by the governor, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, to the emperor Titus. Its theatre, the first Roman theatre in Britain, was built ca 140. An inscription records that the \"civitas\" of the Catuvellauni were involved in the reconstruction of Hadrian\\'s Wall, probably in the time of Septimius Severus in the early 3rd century. Saint Alban, the first British Christian martyr, was a citizen of Verulamium in the late 3rd or early 4th century, and was killed there. The city took its modern name from him. The tombstone of a woman of the Catuvellauni called Regina, freedwoman and wife of Barates, a soldier from Palmyra in Syria, was found in the 4th-century Roman fort of Arbeia in South Shields in the northeast of England.',\n",
       " 'Thorne is a market town and civil parish in the City of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England. It was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It has a population of 16,592, increasing to 17,295 at the 2011 Census. History. The land which is now Thorne was once inhabited by Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age people. It became a permanent settlement around AD\\xa0700, and is mentioned in the \"Domesday Book\". The main industries in the town have traditionally been coal mining and farming. Geography. Thorne lies east of the River Don, on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, and is located at approximately , at an elevation of around above sea level, on the Yorkshire side of the border with Lincolnshire. The civil parish of \"Thorne and Moorends\" includes the village of Moorends to the north, and the Thorne Waste (also known as Thorne Moors) section of the Thorne Moors collective of moorland to the north-east. A small part of the edge of Thorne Waste, named \"the Yorkshire Triangle\", currently falls under North Lincolnshire, by technicality splitting this suburb of the civil parish between South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Culture and community. Thorne Memorial Park is the location for the Thorne Memorial Park Miniature Railway and the annual Thorne Festival. During the summer months, free brass band concerts are held at the park\\'s bandstand. Thorne Community Wood is a community woodland created from agricultural land by Thorne-Moorends Town Council, and The Peatlands Way, a circuitous walk around the wildlife areas of Thorne and Hatfield Moors, passes to the north of the town. Thorne\\'s Farmers\\' Market is a monthly event. The area now has its own Community Radio station, TMCR 95.3. For many decades in the twentieth century Thorne Colliery was a central focus of employment within the town, although its history was very troubled. In recent years, employment opportunities have been increasing, most notably since the opening of Nimbus Park on the outskirts of the town, where The Range have operated a major distribution centre since 2012. Landmarks. Notable buildings in the town include the parish church and Peel Hill Castle. The parish church consists of material from the 12th to 15th centuries with some later additions and repairs. It is a grade I listed structure, and is dedicated to St Nicholas. Peel Hill Castle is the earthwork remains of a Norman motte built by the de Warenne family. Although no structure remains, the foundations indicate that it had a circular keep. It might have been used as a hunting lodge, connected with Hatfield Chase, and prisoners were kept in its tower in the 16th century. It was demolished in the 17th century. The monument is in the care of Thorne-Moorends Town Council. There are Dutch-like bridges over local canals, such as the Wykewell bridge. There is one remaining water tower, located on South End. Another water tower used to stand on Field Road, but was demolished in 2013. The subsequent empty land was, in 2015, earmarked as the planned location for a new Lidl supermarket. Nearby are the extensive Thorne Moors. Transport. The town is served by two railway stations: Thorne North, and Thorne South; as well as Junction 6 of the M18 and junction 1 of the M180. The town is served by four bus services, all of which are operated by First South Yorkshire. The services include the 87/87a towards Doncaster and Moorends, the 84 towards Doncaster, the 87b towards Doncaster and Moorends, and the 86 service. The latter is a local route only connecting both Thorne and Moorends with the newly built retail park. The 8/8a and 86 services only operate on weekdays and Saturdays. The 84 service operates on evenings only Monday to Saturday, and throughout the day hourly on a Sunday, this is due to there being no 87b service on a Sunday. The A614 runs through the town, crossing the canal. Education. In September 2005 a newly built school, Trinity Academy, opened in Thorne, specialising in Business and Enterprise. The £24\\xa0million state-of-the-art Academy has nine classes per year group, had an initial school population of 1250 children between the ages of 11 and 18, and is the third Christian Ethos school founded by Sir Peter Vardy. In 2004, 21% of students from Thorne and Moorends achieved five or more passes at grade C or above. Trinity was named as England\\'s most improved academy in 2007, for which they were presented with an award by Sir Bruce Liddington, the Schools Commissioner in England and Wales, at a conference held in London run by the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust. The academy replaced Thorne Grammar School, whose notable alumni were the opera singer Lesley Garrett; George Porter, a nobel prize-winning chemist; Charles Spencer, pianist; and Sir Graham Hall, former CEO of Yorkshire Electricity. Sport. Thorne\\'s rugby league side, Moorends-Thorne Marauders RLFC, play in the CMS Yorkshire league during the winter season and the Rugby League Conference during the summer. The rugby union side, Thornensians RUFC currently play in Yorkshire Division 3 and have won the Yorkshire Cup on 2 occasions along with the South Yorkshire trophy on a record 12 occasions- the most recent in the 2014-2015 season. Their home ground is Coulman Road and big games can attract crowds above 300. Football is played by the Moorends Hornets and Stingers Junior Football Club. Speedway racing, earlier known as Dirt track racing, was staged at a track on the southern edge of the town in 1930. Billed as \"The Wembley of the North\" the track followed the edge of the football pitch on the inside of the track. Rather than two sweeping bends, the track is shown on contemporary ordnance survey maps as having four corners and four straights. The Sea Cadet unit in Thorne, TS Gambia, offers watersports and other activities to young people within the town.',\n",
       " 'George Wald (November 18, 1906 – April 12, 1997) was an American scientist who studied pigments in the retina. He won a share of the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Haldan Keffer Hartline and Ragnar Granit. In 1970, Wald predicted that \"civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.\" Research. As a postdoctoral researcher, Wald discovered that vitamin A was a component of the retina. His further experiments showed that when the pigment rhodopsin was exposed to light, it yielded the protein opsin and a compound containing vitamin A. This suggested that vitamin A was essential in retinal function. In the 1950s, Wald and his colleagues used chemical methods to extract pigments from the retina. Then, using a spectrophotometer, they were able to measure the light absorbance of the pigments. Since the absorbance of light by retina pigments corresponds to the wavelengths that best activate photoreceptor cells, this experiment showed the wavelengths that the eye could best detect. However, since rod cells make up most of the retina, what Wald and his colleagues were specifically measuring was the absorbance of rhodopsin, the main photopigment in rods. Later, with a technique called microspectrophotometry, he was able to measure the absorbance directly from cells, rather than from an extract of the pigments. This allowed Wald to determine the absorbance of pigments in the cone cells (Goldstein, 2001). Biography. George Wald was born in New York City, the son of Ernestine (Rosenmann) and Isaac Wald, Jewish immigrant parents. He was a member of the first graduating class of the Brooklyn Technical High School in New York in 1923. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from New York University in 1927 and his PhD in zoology from Columbia University in 1932. After graduating, he received a travel grant from the US National Research Council. Wald used this grant to work in Germany with Otto Heinrich Warburg where he identified vitamin A in the retina. Wald then went on to work in Zurich, Switzerland with the discoverer of vitamin A, Paul Karrer. Wald then worked briefly with Otto Fritz Meyerhof in Heidelberg, Germany, but left Europe for the University of Chicago in 1933 when Adolf Hitler came to power and life in Europe became more dangerous for Jews. In 1934, Wald went to Harvard University where he became an instructor, then a professor. Wald was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1950, the American Philosophical Society in 1958, and in 1967 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries in vision. In 1966 he was awarded the Frederic Ives Medal by the OSA and in 1967 the Paul Karrer Gold Medal of the University of Zurich. Wald spoke out on many political and social issues and his fame as a Nobel laureate brought national and international attention to his views. He was a pacifist and vocal opponent of the Vietnam War and the nuclear arms race. Speaking at MIT in 1969 Wald said, \"Our government has become preoccupied with death, with the business of killing and being killed.\" In 1980, Wald served as part of Ramsey Clark\\'s delegation to Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. With a small number of other Nobel laureates, he was invited in 1986 to fly to Moscow to advise Mikhail Gorbachev on a number of environmental questions. While there, he questioned Gorbachev about the arrest, detention and exile of Yelena Bonner and her husband, fellow Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov (Peace prize, 1975). Wald reported that Gorbachev said he knew nothing about it. Bonner and Sakharov were released shortly thereafter, in December 1986. A member of the Circumcision resource center in Boston, he was one of the first scientists committed against circumcision but his article \"Circumcision\", rejected by the New York Times in 1975, was published in 2012 only by an English magazine ( ). Wald died in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was married twice: in 1931 to Frances Kingsley (1906-1980) and in 1958 to the biochemist Ruth Hubbard. He had two sons with Kingsley—Michael and David; he and Hubbard had a son—the award-winning musicologist and musician Elijah Wald—and a daughter, Deborah, a prominent family law attorney. He was an atheist. External links. Two of George Wald\\'s speeches can be read on-line:',\n",
       " 'Following a crackdown on Iranian media beginning in 2000 many Iranians turned to weblogging to provide and find political news. The first Persian language blog is thought to have been created by Hossein Derakhshan, (in Canada), in 2001. Derakhshan also provided readers with a simple instruction manual in Persian on how to start a blog. In 2004, a census of blogs around the world by the NITLE found 64,000 Persian language blogs. In that year the Islamic government also began to arrest and charge bloggers as political dissidents and by 2005 dozens of bloggers had been arrested. History. Early 2001 was the beginning of emergence of a blogging culture, which rapidly developed. the Iranian government, which had strict controls in place for the print media and had shut down as many as 100 print newspapers. Iran has been listed consistently as among the bottom countries in violation of freedom of the press by Reporters without Borders. Yet the internet provided a new means for widespread readership which was, up until 2004, was mostly unregulated, providing an outlet for mostly youth to express themselves freely. In 2009, due to the contentious nature of the presidential elections, and the rise of the green party movement, internet crackdowns have become far more strict. Despite 43% of the internet is using wordpress to create blogs to express their thoughts on the internet, the Iranian government strictly controls the internet making it tough for anyone to express their view online. Nonetheless, , according to the CIA world factbook, 8.214 million internet users in Iran, ranked 35th in the world. Blogs range from updates on art and critiquing movies, to following injustices of political prisoners. Diasporic Persian and Iranian blogs have also become a trend as a means to be part of an international online community. Blogs may be used as a virtual means of social protest without assembly, such as when thousands of bloggers renamed their blogs Akbar Ganji for a week in 2005, in support of the arrested critic of the regime. Hossien Derakhshan, the unofficial \"godfather\" of the blogosphere, set his up in Canada in September 2001. He was later arrested. In 2011, Iranian authorities executed more than 600 people and imprisoned more journalists and bloggers than any other country. Scope. The broad usage of weblogs in Iran was staggering. , the NITLE (National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education)blog census found the number of blogs in Persian surpassed 64,000. Some believe that the influence of these blogs have been exaggerated, in that their authors are predominantly upper and upper-middle class. However, the education system in Iran gives access to education and therefore new technologies, computers and the internet as a whole to large numbers of lower-class people. Appeal. Blogs often give a sense of anonymity. Political importance. Blogging in Iran took on political importance as the regime continued its crackdown on journalists. The Iranian press is highly regulated, especially under the Press Law, which according to the UNHCR, \"forbids the publication of ideas that are contrary to Islamic principles or detrimental to public rights.\" This includes imprisonment for \"propaganda,\" which remains undefined, and for offenses that are \"an insult to religion.\" Because as many as 100 publications were shut down in the early 2000s, many sought alternative outlets for reporting and freedom of expression. This often came about in critiques of the regime, which was relatively unregulated until 2004. Implicit and explicit condemnation is common, such as is evident in the following excerpts. \"11 July 2003: On occasion something happens in life that makes you want to believe in miracles. Like today! Coming across a copy of Kieslowski\\'s Three colours Blue/ White/ Red among the videos at home- without anyone remembering having borrowed it from a friend... This was one of those majestic miracles that only a higher being can bestow on a special someone like me. Thank You God!\" The viewing of movies in ones home is forbidden, as are most western films. More explicit expressions of dissent as also common: \"25 November 2002: Every Day new intrigues and tyrannies by our repressive turbaned rulers...And crazy Muslims around the world that bring nothing but carnage and shame...I swear to god...if it weren\\'t for clergy like Eshkavari who keep telling us that what they do is not Islam...I would abandon this little faith once and for all\" Iranian officials became concerned that the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine might induce foreign attempts to support a similar revolution in Iran, by building civil society networks and empowering activists as had happened in Ukraine. This was compounded by the 2006 announcement by the U.S. State Department that it was creating a $75 million fund to \"reach out to the people of Iran\". This caused the Iranian government to closely monitor foreign support for bloggers and journalists. In 2004 the government began to arrest and charge bloggers as political dissidents. It also began demanding shutdowns and screening of internet service providers, a big step in restriction that had been relatively unregulated. In 2005 the BBC World Service Trust started the Iran Media Development Project, to support new media in Iran, following on from earlier projects such as Jadid Media funded by the Netherlands. In 2006 it created a secure training and mentoring website for aspiring Iranian and Afghan bloggers and journalists, with an online magazine edited by Sina Motalebi for the trainees supported by a radio programme for young people in Iran, called ZigZag. Circa 2006 estimates suggested there were about 500,000 to 800,000 blogs in Iran, though not all were active. In 2009, internet users and particularly bloggers and online journalists were targeted for arrest and violence after the contested re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who won by a landslide, inciting fraud allegations. Critical publications were shut down and the largest number of journalists were jailed since the 1979 revolution. The Press Law was also formally extended to \"all internet publications\" which may include blogs, requiring the authors to get licenses. According to ONI, with the sophisticated system of internet filtering developed by Iran, the websites Blogger and Persianblog are often blocked. Yet in response to the vitality of the Iranian blogosphere, the government decided to pursue other tactics simultaneously, announcing in late 2008 its intention to create thousands of pro government blogs, including one by the president himself. Thus the internet, and in particular blogs became an important front in informal political debate, declarations, and dissatisfaction. Hossein Derakhshan. Born in Iran in 1975, Hossein Derakhshan, commonly referred to as the \"blogging godfather\" or the \"blogfather,\" moved to Canada in 2000. His blog became the first Persian blog, and took off in 2001 with his simple instruction manual on how to set up and write a Persian-language blog. In 2003 his blog became highly political, encouraging opposition through writing. In 2006 he went back to the middle east, visited Egypt and met with Egyptian blogger when the Egyptian blogosphere was also at its peak activity. In the same tour Hissein visited Israel publicly, seeking to mend relations between Iran and Israel, which are sworn enemies. In the same year, he also backed presidential candidate Ahmadinejad. In 2008 he was arrested while visiting family in Iran and was sentenced to 19 and a half years in prison, banned from political party membership for five years, and ordered to repay earnings of around $44,500 for \"propagating against the regime\" and \"co-operating with hostile states.\" In 2010 he was temporarily released on bail of 1.5 million dollars. Shirin Ebadi nobel peace prize news. The power of the Iranian blogs was demonstrated in 2003, with the Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Because her human rights work had much to do with representing women, children, and dissidents against the regime, the official Iranian news failed to report the win. Several hours later it included in the nightly news a 15-second mention of the win, while failing to report her actual accomplishments aside for \"a children\\'s charity.\" Rather than traditional channels, therefore, the news and reactions to it spread on multiple blogs. Nasrin Alavi, author of We Are Iran, brings the statistics of www.damasanj.com, a website which works out which stories are most talked about in the Iranian blogosphere, which found that Ebadi dominated the top ten Rankings.8 Most were congratulatory, and sought to provide bios and facts on the nature of Ebadi\\'s work, which the traditional press had failed to print. Bloggers went a step farther when they organized a reception for Ebadi at the Teheran airport upon her return on October 14, 2003. They called for people to celebrate her victory, as well as use the venue to protest the current situation of women\\'s rights and oppression. Rather than the media, it was bloggers that provided up to date pictures of the reception to the public. Thousands of people attended, proving that bloggers could translate to actual events. Eventually this forced the government to respond to Ebadi\\'s Prize in a more serious light: it cast Ebadi as an apostate and a member of a foreign conspiracy against Iran. Bam. The December 2003 Bam earthquake caused particular outrage and made clear the necessity for blogging as a news source. While the regime was ill-equipped to deal with the disaster where an estimated 30,000 people lost their lives. The aftermath was tremendous in damages, and a lack of journalists to cover the quake. Blogs, therefore, became a central source of information. For example, Dr. Marajan Haj-Ahmadi\\'s blog became one of the most read, as she was based in the bordering city of Kerman and was able to report from the area and provide information as to the medical inadequacies. Others included Baba\\'s blog, an anonymous ex-newspaper journalist who entered the region to provide accurate news reports from the disaster zone. The survivors of the Bam earthquake also began protesting due to lack of governmental support, which went unreported in the official news but the shooting of two individuals at a Friday prayer was reported by bloggers. In her book \"We are Iran: The Persian Blogs\" Nasrin Alavi claims that the earthquake was a turning point for blogs being organizing forces as well as partnering with NGO\\'s rather than governmental organizations: The translation from a virtual page into actual human mobility lent legitimacy to the blogger movement, as well as proving it to be a resilient form of networking that had practical applications. It also proved the fears of the government in that it began to resemble a movement rather than simply disconnected expressions of personal experiences. Transition to Facebook. While blogging remains a key form of political protest, in the 2009 uprisings, Facebook began to take a more central role. The physical, rather than virtual protests spread through word-of-mouth rather than blogs. When possible, instances of police abuse were captured on mobile phone videos and then uploaded to YouTube, most famously the video of Neda Agha Soltan being shot to death in the streets of Teheran. These videos were shared on Facebook, fueling the protests. Originally blocked by the government in 2006, it had been unblocked in 2009, just months before the protests. Language: the Use of English and other foreign languages. More recently, Persian has become just one of many Iranian blog languages. English in particular is used. This is both because it is a relatively well known second language due to high education levels, and to expose the outside world to the goings on in Iran. Several influential bloggers made a plea to other bloggers to use this medium to increase international outrage at the Iranian regime. It also seeks to provide a lens from which to see the Iranian people as separate from their repressive government. Additionally, many blogs being read are written abroad by diasporic communities of Iranians throughout the globe. Many of their families left during the Brain-drain following the Islamic revolution in 1979 and after, creating a dedicated politically motivated and educated author base. These people use their native or adopted languages in addition to Persian. Women in blogging. Some of the most popular Iranian bloggers are women. The outlet often provides a means to escape the need to identify oneself openly, particularly as family honor can be associated with women. The internet provides a means to talk about the restrictions on women, including the mandatory Hijab. Women can communicate with men openly as contributors of commentators on each other\\'s blog, even having virtual boyfriends online. They can talk about premarital sex, underground parties, alcohol and other youth activities often frowned upon or considered illegal. It also allows for following fashion trends, music, and feminist news. For example, one blogger addresses the issue of prostitution under the regime, which is formally denied. \"22 August 2003: some facts: The rate of runaway girls has grown 20 times between the periods of 1986-1999, with the average age of girls now 14.7...the average age of prostitutes has dropped from 27 to 20 years.\" Due to the extremely high education rate of women, females even surpassing males in enrollment in university, access and literacy are readily available. Some popular female bloggers include 2003 student uprisings Iran In 2003 there were a series of student uprisings throughout the country, despite widespread repression during 1999 riots. largely reported on blogs, providing news and updates for others, while it was not being reported by the press. This allowed for more organized, planned protests. Eventually they too were repressed, but not without using the internet and blogs as a means to defy authority.',\n",
       " 'Southwestern University (Southwestern or SU) is a private liberal arts college in Georgetown, Texas. Formed in 1873 from a revival of collegiate charters granted in 1840, Southwestern is the oldest college or university in Texas. Southwestern offers 40 bachelor\\'s degrees in the arts, sciences, fine arts, and music as well as interdisciplinary and pre-professional programs. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the National Association of Schools of Music and historically affiliated with the United Methodist Church. The institution is a member of the Annapolis Group, the Associated Colleges of the South, the Council of Independent Colleges, and is a signatory of the Talloires Declaration. History. Prior to assuming its current form, charters had been granted by the Texas Legislature (Texas Congress 1836–1845) to establish four educational institutions: Rutersville College of Rutersville, Texas, \"Wesleyan College\" of San Augustine, Texas, McKenzie College of Clarksville, Texas, and Soule University of Chappell Hill, Texas. In 1873, the union of these four institutions opened in Georgetown as \"Texas University\". Intending to reserve that name for a proposed state university in Austin, the University of Texas, the Texas Legislature instead granted a charter in 1875 under the name \"Southwestern University\" as a continuation of the charters for Rutersville, Wesleyan, McKenzie, and Soule. The institution considers its founding date to be 1840 when Rutersville College opened. Southwestern thus claims to be the oldest university in Texas and the second oldest coeducational liberal arts college west of the Mississippi. Southwestern was a charter member of the Southwest Conference in 1915. Southern Methodist University was Southwestern\\'s main rival for several decades in remembrance of an unsuccessful attempt to relocate Southwestern to Dallas which instead resulted in the establishment of SMU. When SMU\\'s student population became much larger, students at Southwestern began considering Trinity University and Austin College to be the school\\'s main rivals. After World War II, Southwestern transformed itself into a small liberal arts institution, discontinuing its post-graduate degrees, disbanding the football team, and rebuilding much of the campus with a massive capital campaign. The endowment rose substantially. Until 1965, no African-Americans were allowed to attend the institution. In 1965, Ernest Clark enrolled; he graduated in 1969. Former president Edward B. Burger stepped down in January 2020 and assumed the role of president and CEO of St. David\\'s Foundation. Southwestern trustee and former provost Dale T. Knobel assumed interim presidency of Southwestern until Laura Skandera Trombley began her term as president on July 1, 2020. Academics. The institution offers 40 majors and 36 minors divided between the Brown College of Arts, Garey School of Natural Sciences, and the Sarofim School of Fine Arts. In addition to traditional academic majors, Southwestern offers interdisciplinary, independent, and paired majors as well as pre-professional programs in Engineering, Law, Medicine, and Theology. Its most popular majors, based on 2021 graduates, were: In the 2013–2014 academic year, total student enrollment was at 1,536, with a gender distribution of about 60 percent female and 40 percent male. Of the entering first-year students in Fall 2013, 37 percent were in the top 10 percent of their high school graduating class with an average SAT score of 1166 (*writing section not included). While the majority of students come from Texas (89 percent), the remaining 11 percent come from 23 other states and 6 countries. Minority students constitute 33 percent of the student body. The student to faculty ratio is 11:1, with an average class size of 15 students. Ninety-nine percent of the tenured or tenure-track faculty hold a doctorate or highest degree in their fields. Collaborative research and publication with students is common. Research. Southwestern hosts two interdisciplinary academic exhibitions each year to showcase research by students at Southwestern and researchers across the country. The \"Brown Symposium\" held in the early spring is an academic conference attracting guest lecturers and panelists. All Brown Symposium speakers present research that shares the symposium\\'s theme for that year. The \"Creative Works Symposium\" held near the end of the spring semester offers undergraduate students an opportunity to display their own research as a formal oral presentation, panel discussion, poster presentation, art exhibit, or technology demonstration. These student presentations are often the culmination of senior capstone projects, independent studies, collaborations with a faculty member, or a requirement for receiving research grants. Speaker series. Southwestern has a history of drawing prolific lecturers to campus, including William Jennings Bryan, Helen Keller, bell hooks, and alumnus J. Frank Dobie. Orators traveling by train often stopped off on their way to or from Austin, giving their lectures and catching the next train. Speakers at the annual Brown Symposium have included Isaac Asimov (through a video conference) in the early 1980s and Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz in 2002. Since it began, the Shilling Lecture series has brought a variety of prominent figures, including presidential advisor Karen Hughes (2003), Archbishop Desmond Tutu (2004), former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto (2005), former Governor of New Jersey Thomas Kean (2006), former Secretary of State James Baker (2007), former U.S. senator Bill Bradley (2008), Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai (2009), senior fellow in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Global Health Program William Foege (2010), founder of TOMs Shoes Blake Mycoskie (2011), and three-time Pulitzer Prize winner Thomas Friedman (2012). In 2002, The Writer\\'s Voice series presented Pulitzer Prize winning author Michael Chabon. The Writer\\'s Voice has also welcomed such authors as Joyce Carol Oates (2000), Margaret Atwood (2003), Amy Tan (2007), and Azar Nafisi (2008). Awards and rankings. Loren Pope, former education editor for \"The New York Times\", included Southwestern in his 1996 book, \"Colleges That Change Lives\", and in a 2012 update to that book. Campus. Southwestern University is located in Georgetown, Texas, about 30 miles (50\\xa0km) north of Austin. The campus comprises 700 acres (2.8\\xa0km²) mostly located north of University Avenue, although the eastern portion of these lands remains largely undeveloped with some portions serving as an EcoLab where faculty and students conduct research. The main campus is organized around a central academic mall formed by a semi-circular grassy area bounded by a pedestrian walkway and academic buildings. Residence halls and on-campus apartments are located to the east and northwest of the academic mall. Sports fields, support facilities, and parking are on the periphery of the main campus. Notable buildings. The Hugh Roy and Lillie Cullen Building (formerly called the Administration Building) was built in 1898 in the Richardsonian Romanesque style and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Cullen Building currently houses the administration, business office, alumni relations, and classrooms. Throughout various times in its history, it has also housed the campus auditorium, gymnasium, chapel, and library. It is named in honor of Hugh Roy Cullen and his wife. Mood-Bridwell Hall, originally a men\\'s dormitory, was completed in 1908 and currently houses classrooms, faculty offices, a computer lab, the Debbie Ellis Writing Center, and an indoor atrium. Mood-Bridwell is included in the Cullen Building\\'s listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The A. Frank Smith Library Center opened in 1939 as the Cody Memorial Library and was built as part of a WPA project. It was expanded in 1966 and again in 1989, receiving the new name as a result of the second expansion. In addition to books and periodicals, the library houses a film and audio collection, 24-hour computer lab, maps, sheet music, and special collections for Texas history and culture, John Tower, J. Frank Dobie, Jessie Daniel Ames, Herman Melville, Aaron Burr, Edward Blake, Thomas Bewick, and Australia. The Lois Perkins Chapel was built in 1950 and includes an Aeolian-Skinner pipe organ. Stained glass windows along the east and west sides depict Reformation leaders and Methodist leaders with seals for the educational institutions they were affiliated with. The McCombs Campus Center opened in 1998, replacing the Bishops\\' Memorial Student Union Building and University Commons. It includes dining facilities, the campus bookstore, ballrooms, and student organization offices. It is named for billionaire entrepreneur and Southwestern alum Red McCombs. The Fayez Sarofim School of Fine Arts is housed in the Alma Thomas Fine Arts Building, originally built in 1956 on the former property of the Texas rancher John Wesley Snyder, a Southwestern University benefactor. The Fine Arts Building (FAB) has been renovated multiple times, most recently in 1998 and 2008. The FAB houses the 700-seat Alma Thomas Theater, the smaller Jones Theater, the Caldwell-Carvey Foyer, numerous practice rooms, art studios, a black box theater, and an instrumental rehearsal hall. The Wilhelmina Cullen Admission Center opened in 2009, moving the admissions office out of the Roy and Lillie Cullen Building. It is Southwestern\\'s first \"green\" building and was designed to receive Gold LEED certification. Some of the building\\'s features include a bamboo floor in the lobby area, skylights in the center of the building, solar-powered sink faucets and reflective roof shingles. Southwestern plans to turn the area in the original Cullen Building formerly occupied by the Admission Office into a museum. The Admissions Center was named after Wilhelmina Cullen, the daughter of Roy and Lillie Cullen. Student activities and organizations. There are over 90 student organizations on campus. The school hosts chapters of 16 academic honor societies, including a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, a chapter of Beta Beta Beta (TriBeta), and the founding chapter of the Alpha Chi honor society. The national co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega also has a chapter. Several groups on campus participate in social activism and awareness on campus and in the Austin area, including College Democrats, Students for Environmental Activism and Knowledge (SEAK), Latinos Unidos, EBONY, and Amnesty International. Religious groups on campus include the national Christian fraternity Kappa Upsilon Chi, Christian sorority Sigma Phi Lambda, Jewish Student Association, Muslims and Allies, and Buddhist Meditation Group. Other groups include Southwestern Breakaway, Mock Trial, Student Health Advisory Council (SHAC), Best Buddies, Cat Partners, Exercise is Medicine, Robotics Club, Business Club, and much more. Student government. Student government is primarily handled by the Student Congress, with each member elected to represent students living in residence halls, Greek houses, and at-large for students living off-campus. The Student Congress is headed by a president elected through popular vote. An independent organization, Student Foundation, serves as a liaison between students, faculty, alumni, and the administration. A panel of students and faculty maintain the institution\\'s honor code, replacing the Student Judiciary which previously adjudicated violations of the honor code. Greek life. Southwestern hosts eight national social fraternities and sororities governed by the North-American Interfraternity Council (IFC) and the National Panhellenic Council (NPC). All fraternities occupy houses on the western side of the campus. The sororities do not have dedicated housing, although they maintain chapter rooms in the Lord Caskey Center. Southwestern has a deferred rush allowing incoming students to become familiar with the campus before formal recruitment begins in the early spring. About 1/3 of the student life is involved in Greek life. IFC Fraternities/NPC Sororities. Southwestern also has the Alpha Tau chapter of Kappa Delta Chi sorority. The Alpha Tau chapter is also a member of Southwestern\\'s umbrella organization the Coalition for Diversity and Social Justice. Media. \"The Megaphone\", established in 1907, is the official student newspaper of Southwestern University. Published online and biweekly in print, the newspaper focuses on the campus community, including sections on news, features, opinions/editorials, culture, and sports. Throughout its history, the Megaphone has changed formats several times, alternating between broadsheets and tabloid paper. The newspaper publishes an April Fool\\'s Day edition every spring under the title \"The Megaphool\". \"Spyglass Literary Magazine\" is the student literary magazine. The magazine is the oldest publication on campus, established in 1882 as the \"Alamo and San Jacinto Monthly\" and renamed the \"Southwestern University Monthly\" in 1895, then the \"SU Literary Magazine\", and finally \"The Spyglass\" in 2012. Currently published twice a year at the end of each semester, the magazine features student poetry, short stories, artwork, and photography. \"SU Radio\" is an online radio station broadcasting music and student commentary in hour-long programming blocks. Athletics. Southwestern is a member of the NCAA Division III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC). Southwestern competes in 20 varsity sports, including football, basketball, cross country, track & field, golf, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, lacrosse, men\\'s baseball, women\\'s volleyball and women\\'s softball. Intramural sports on campus include handball, rock climbing, and ultimate frisbee. The school mascot is the pirate. The men\\'s lacrosse team became a varsity sport in 2009 after offering lacrosse as a club sport for 25 years. The men\\'s lacrosse team won the Lonestar Alliance Division II Championship for four consecutive years prior to becoming a varsity sport. The women\\'s team is currently non-varsity and is affiliated with the Texas Women\\'s Lacrosse League, although the university plans to field a varsity team in 2014. The women\\'s team won a division championships in 2007. In addition to lacrosse, Southwestern has a nationally ranked handball team that won the Division II National Collegiate Championship in 2007. In September 2016, Southwestern\\'s volleyball team moved up to 3rd place in the AVCA coaches poll as well. Southwestern reinstated football in 2013 after a 62-year hiatus. The institution previously fielded football teams from 1908 to 1951, reaching national prominence during World War II when the institution\\'s participation in the Navy\\'s V-12 College Training Program enlisted talented players from other schools. Southwestern was a founding member of the Southwest Conference and won the Sun Bowl in 1944 and 1945. Southwestern University Women\\'s Soccer team won its first-ever SCAC Championship in 2019, defeating Trinity University on penalty kicks.',\n",
       " 'Hertfordshire is an English county, founded in the Norse–Saxon wars of the 9th century, and developed through commerce serving London. It is a land-locked county that was several times the seat of Parliament. From origins in brewing and papermaking, through aircraft manufacture, the county has developed a wider range of industry in which pharmaceuticals, financial services and film-making are prominent. Today, with a population slightly over 1 million, Hertfordshire services, industry and commerce dominate the economy, with fewer than 2000 people working in agriculture, forestry and fishing. Hertfordshire is one of the historic counties of England first recorded in the early 10th century. Its development has been tied with that of London, which lies on its southern border. London is the largest city in Western Europe; it requires an enormous tonnage of supplies each day and Hertfordshire grew wealthy on the proceeds of trade because no less than three of the old Roman roads serving the capital run through it, as do the Grand Union Canal and other watercourses. In the 19th century, rail links sprang up in the county, linking London to the north. Hatfield in Hertfordshire has seen two rail crashes of international importance (in 1870 and 2000). Though nowadays Hertfordshire tends to be politically conservative, historically it was the site of a number of uprisings against the Crown, particularly in the First Barons\\' War, the Peasants\\' Revolt, the Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War. The county has a rich intellectual history, and many writers of major importance, from Geoffrey Chaucer to Beatrix Potter, have connections there. Quite a number of Prime Ministers were born or grew up in Hertfordshire. The county contains a curiously large number of abandoned settlements, which K. Rutherford Davis attributes to a mixture of poor harvests on soil hard to farm, and the Black Death which ravaged Hertfordshire starting in 1349. Early history. The earliest evidence of human occupation in Hertfordshire come from a gravel pit in Rickmansworth. The finds (of flint tools) date back 350,000 years, long before Britain became an island. People have probably lived in the land now called Hertfordshire for about 12,000 years, since the Mesolithic period in Ware (making Ware one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe). Settlement continued through the Neolithic period, with evidence of occupation sites, enclosures, long barrows and even an unusual dog cemetery in the region. Although occupied, the area had a relatively low population in the Neolithic and early Bronze Age, perhaps because of its heavy, relatively poorly drained soil. Nevertheless, just south of present-day Ware and Hertford there is some evidence of an increase in the population, with typical round huts and farming activity having been found at a site called Foxholes Farm. There is no evidence of settlement at Hertford itself from this period, although Ware and perhaps Hertford seem to have been occupied during Roman times. In the Iron Age, a Celtic tribe called the Catuvellauni occupied Hertfordshire. Their main settlement (or oppidum) was Verlamion on the River Ver (near present-day St Albans). Other \"oppida\" in Hertfordshire include sites at Cow Roast near Tring, Wheathampstead, Welwyn, Braughing, and Baldock. Hertfordshire contains several Iron Age hill forts, including the largest example in Eastern England at Ravensburgh Castle in Hexton. There is a wealth of Iron Age burial sites in Hertfordshire, making it a place of international importance in Iron Age study. The large number of sites of all types indicates dense and complex settlement patterns immediately prior to the Roman invasion. The Roman Invasion of Britain. In 55\\xa0BCE when the Romans first attempted to invade Britain, the Catuvellauni (which is Brythonic for \"Expert Warrior\") were the largest British tribe. Caesar\\'s report to the Senate said that \"Cassivellaun\" (Cassivellaunus) was leader of the Britons, and Cassivellaunus\\' headquarters were near Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire. On Caesar\\'s second invasion attempt in 54\\xa0BCE, Cassivellaunus led the British defensive forces. The Romans besieged him at Wheathampstead, and partly because of the defection of the Trinovantes (whose King Cassivellaunus had had murdered), the Catuvellauni were forced to surrender. However, after the siege of Wheathampstead, Caesar returned to Rome without leaving a garrison. Cunobelinus became king of the Catuvellauni in 9 or 10 CE and ruled for about thirty years, conquering such a large area of Britain that the Roman writer Suetonius called him \"Britannorum Rex\" ( \"King of Britain\"). He built Beech Bottom Dyke, a defensive earthwork, at St Albans, which may be related to another Iron Age defensive earthwork, the Devil\\'s Dyke, at Cassivellaunus\\' headquarters in nearby Wheathampstead. The Romans defeated the Catuvellauni again in July 43 CE and this time, garrisoned Britain. When the Romans took over, their settlement, laid out in 49 CE, became known as Verulamium. Alban, a Roman army officer who became Britain\\'s first Christian martyr after his arrest at Chantry Island, died in the 3rd or 4th century and gave his name to the modern town of St Albans. Verulamium became one of Roman Britain\\'s major cities, the third-largest and the only to be granted self-governing status. Strong though Verulamium\\'s defences may have been, they were not enough to stop Boudica, who burned the city in 61 CE. Verulamium was rebuilt, with defences enclosing a site of some and was occupied into the 5th century. A number of Roman Roads run through Hertfordshire including Watling Street and Ermine Street. The ancient trackway, the Icknield Way also runs through Hertfordshire. These are three of the \"four highways\" of medieval England (the other being the Fosse Way, which does not run through Hertfordshire) which were still the main routes through the country more than a thousand years later. The first Roman Road to be built was the Military Way, constructed very early in the Roman conquest to speed the troops\\' access north. Later, Ermine Street would be built directly on top of it. Hertfordshire in the Early Middle Ages. After the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, the Hertfordshire area formed parts of the Kingdom of Mercia and the Kingdom of Essex. The main early Saxon tribes there seem to have been the \"Hicce\", \"Brahhingas\" and \"Wæclingas\". Place names tend to derive from Celtic rather than Saxon, and there is a \"singular lack of Early Saxon place names.\" The Synod of Hertford, which was the first national Synod of the English Church, took place on 26\\xa0September 672–3. It was at this Synod that the \"question of Easter\" was settled, and the church agreed how to calculate the date of Easter. The Synod also marked the end of the conflict between the Celtic Church and the Romanised church introduced by Saint Augustine. King Offa of Mercia (died 796) built a church at Hitchin in Hertfordshire, but it burned down in 910\\xa0CE and the monks moved to St Albans. Offa defeated Beornred of Mercia at Pirton, near Hitchin and gave his name to the village of Offley (\"Offa\\'s Lea\"). Some sources (including Matthew Paris, who was a monk at St Albans) suggest he died at Offley, though he was buried fifteen miles away in Bedford. One of Offa\\'s last acts was to found St Albans Abbey. Origins of the county. The word Hertfordshire (Saxon \"Heorotfordscir\" or \"Heorotfordscír\") is attested from 866. The first reference (as \"Heoroford\") in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" is for 1011, but the county\\'s true origins lie in the 10th century, when Edward the Elder established two \"burhs\" in Hertford in 912 and 913 respectively. Hertfordshire did not exist in any practical sense in the late 9th century. In the war between Saxon and Norseman, Hertfordshire was on the front line. When, after the Saxon victory in the Battle of Ethandun in 878, the Saxon King Alfred the Great and Norse King Guthrum the Old agreed to partition England between them, the dividing line between their territories split what was to become Hertfordshire almost through the middle, along the line of the River Lea and then along Watling Street. Their agreement survives in the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum which establishes the Danelaw\\'s extent. It seems the land now comprising Hertfordshire was then partly in the Kingdom of Essex (nominally under Norse control, though still populated by Saxons) and partly in the Kingdom of Mercia (which remained Saxon). Alfred was also responsible for building weirs on the River Lea at Hertford (Saxon \"Heorotford\", ford used by deer) and Ware (Saxon \"Waras\", weir), presumably to prevent Viking ships coming upriver. King Edgar the Peaceful is credited with making Hertford the capital of the surrounding shire, presumably between 973 and 975\\xa0CE. Early Middle Ages. Alfred died in 899, and his son Edward the Elder worked with Alfred\\'s son-in-law, Æthelred, and daughter, Æthelflæd, to re-take parts of southern England from the Norse. During these campaigns he built the two \"burhs\" of Hertford as already noted. Their sites have not been found, and probably lie beneath the streets of Hertford itself. From Hertford, together with Stafford, Tamworth and Witham, Edward and Æthelflæd pushed the Danes back to Northumbria in a series of battles. Anglo-Saxon Hertford is an example of town planning as demonstrated by its organised rectangular grid street pattern. There is considerable evidence of a mint in Hertford at this period. Edward the Martyr (from 975 to 978), Æthelred the Unready (from 978 to 1016) and Knut the Great (from 1016 to 1035) all had coins struck there. The mint itself has not been found, but many coins exist. Over 90% of these coins were found on the Continent or in Scandinavia, which may suggest they were used for payment of Danegeld. The St Brice\\'s Day massacre of 1002 probably started at Welwyn in Hertfordshire. The massacre was to be a slaughter of the Norse in England, including women and children. One of those executed was Gunhilde, the sister of King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark. He invaded England next year in retaliation. Forkbeard\\'s assault on England lasted ten years, until 1013, when Æthelred fled to the continent. Forkbeard was crowned King of England on Christmas Day, but only reigned for five weeks before dying. Æthelred returned briefly and unsuccessfully until 1016, at which time he was succeeded by Forkbeard\\'s son Knut, who granted the Royal Manor of Hitchin to his second in command, Earl Tovi. High Middle Ages. After the Norman Invasion, Edgar the Ætheling (the successor to Harold Godwinson) surrendered to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. William created the manor of Berkhamsted, and bestowed it on Robert, Count of Mortain, who was his half-brother. From Robert\\'s son William de Mortain it passed to King Henry I, and is still owned by the Royal Family. Henry held court there in 1123. The Domesday Book, completed in 1086, lists 168\\xa0settlements in Hertfordshire. Hertfordshire\\'s population grew quickly from then until the Black Death reached the county in 1349. The Norman church at St Albans Abbey was finished in 1088. Hertfordshire had a conflicted relationship with the King during the High Middle Ages. Like most counties in the south-east, most of Hertfordshire was in private (i.e. non-royal) ownership during the High Middle Ages. Royal land comprised about 7% of the county\\'s area. The first Earl of Hertford, Gilbert de Clare, was so titled in 1138. He bore one of the first two sets of heraldic arms in England: three gold chevrons on a red shield. His grandson Richard de Clare once offered King John £100 in respect of legal proceedings concerning his inheritance, but then during the First Barons War he sided with the Barons against the King. Richard became one of the twenty-five Barons sworn to enforce the Magna Carta, for which he was excommunicated in 1215. Thomas Becket, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1161, held the honour of Berkhamsted Castle from 1155 until 1163. King Henry II celebrated Christmas there in 1163. Around this time, motte-and-bailey castles were built in Great Wymondley, Pirton and Therfield. Watford was founded in the 12th century, probably as a result of a market and church set up there by the Abbot of St Albans. In 1130, the earliest Pipe Roll shows that King Henry I\\'s Queen Consort Adeliza owned property in the county. The first draft of the Magna Carta was written at St Albans Abbey in 1213. It contained significant provisions still in force to this day, including the principle of \"habeas corpus\" (which was first invoked in court in 1305). Two years later, King John was in St Albans when he learned of the Archbishop of Canterbury\\'s suspension. Though John agreed to the Magna Carta, he did not adhere to it, and Hertfordshire was the main battlefield in the civil war that followed. On 16\\xa0December 1216, during the First Barons\\' War, Hertford Castle surrendered after a siege from Dauphin Louis (later Louis VIII of France), whom the English barons had invited to England to replace John as King. Berkhamsted Castle surrendered around the same time. In winter 1217, royalist forces plundered St Albans, took captives and extorted £100 from the Abbot, who feared the Abbey would be burned. In 1261 King Henry III held parliament in the county. In 1295, another parliament was held in St Albans, and in 1299, King Edward I gave Hertford Castle to his wife Margaret of France on her wedding day. Hertfordshire is largely on a clay sub-soil, and much of its land, though rich, is \"heavy\" and not well-suited to crop cultivation with a medieval plough. However, the county did grow good barley which later became important for the brewing trade. Hertfordshire developed more through commerce than through agriculture which drove most of England\\'s economy during this period. In the High Middle Ages, the county was relatively urbanised by medieval standards, but because towns follow roads and Hertfordshire had many small roads rather than a few large ones, there was no large conurbation. Commerce grew in Hertfordshire from the start of the 12th century; the number of markets and fairs rose steadily from about 1100 until the Black Death. During the 13th century, Hertfordshire\\'s commerce grew still further. The county traded in butter and cheese, and to a lesser extent meat, hides and leather. Much of this produce was bound for London. The county also developed its inns and other services for travellers to and from London. The Knights Templar built Baldock, starting around 1140. In 1185, a survey of the Knights\\' holdings showed Baldock had 122 tenants on of land and several skilled craftsmen. King John granted the Knights a fair and market at Baldock in 1199, to be held annually. It began on St Matthew\\'s Day and lasted five days in all. At around the same time, the leatherworking trade was prominent in Hitchin. An English pope. Nicholas Breakspear, the only Englishman ever to have been elected Pope, was born on a farm in Bedmond or Abbots Langley in Hertfordshire, probably around 1100. He was baptised in Abbots Langley. Nicholas was refused permission to become a monk at St Albans, but his career does not seem to have suffered for this, and he was unanimously elected Pope on 2\\xa0December 1154, taking the papal name Adrian IV. He died in 1159. He was the Pope who placed Rome under an interdict, and is famous for his alleged Donation of Ireland to the English throne. Late Middle Ages. In 1302, King Edward I granted Kings Langley to the Prince of Wales. King Edward II\\'s \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, loved the palace at Kings Langley and he was buried there after his death in 1312. Edmund of Langley, the first Duke of York and founder of the House of York, was born in Kings Langley on 5\\xa0June 1341 and died there on 1\\xa0August 1402. Richard of Wallingford, the mathematician and astronomer, became Abbot of St Albans in 1326. He is regarded as the father of modern trigonometry. Hertford Castle was used as a gaol for a series of important captives during the Hundred Years\\' War. This was actually a series of separate wars that lasted a total of 116 years, between 1337 and 1453. The Plantagenet Kings of England fought the Valois Kings of France, almost entirely on French soil. Queen Isabella was imprisoned by her son, the King, in Hertford Castle in 1330, as were King David II of Scotland and his queen in 1346, after the Battle of Neville\\'s Cross. King John II of France was imprisoned there in 1359 in considerable luxury. The Black Death midway through the 14th century massively reduced Hertfordshire\\'s population. The number of residents probably fell by 30%–50%, and likely took until the 16th century to recover. This meant many of the settlements in Hertfordshire were abandoned, particularly in the north and east of the county where farm yields were poor. Near Tring, a cluster of deserted medieval villages can still be seen. However, the residents who survived grew richer. The reduced population meant workers could demand higher wages and better conditions, despite laws such as the Ordinance of Labourers of 1349 and the Statute of Labourers of 1351. These changed economic conditions contributed to the Peasants\\' Revolt in 1381, in which Hertfordshire\\'s people were deeply involved. (Perhaps confusingly, another man called Richard of Wallingford was one of revolt leader Wat Tyler\\'s principal allies. This is not the same man as the Abbot of St Albans.) After Wat Tyler had been caught and executed, King Richard II went to St Albans to quell the rebels. Richard\\'s body was buried at Kings Langley church in Hertfordshire in 1400, but he was moved to Westminster Abbey in 1413, next to his wife Anne. That same year, King Henry IV appointed his knight Hugh de Waterton to Berkhamsted Castle to supervise his children John and Philippa. King Henry IV moved his government temporarily to St Albans early in his reign for fear of public opinion in London. He gave the castle and honour of Hertford to Edmund, Earl of Stafford, and his wife Anne. Edmund was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. King Henry V married Catherine of France on 2\\xa0June 1420, and gave Hertford Castle to her. In 1413, King Henry V kept Easter at Kings Langley. He gave the alm of a groat to the poor. Henry Chichele, the Archbishop of Canterbury, visited Barnet in 1423. No bells rang, and the archbishop took offence at his poor welcome. When he returned in 1426, the church doors were sealed against him. Three important battles of the Wars of the Roses took place in Hertfordshire. At the First Battle of St Albans on 22\\xa0May 1455, which was the first major battle of the Wars of the Roses, Richard of York and Neville the Kingmaker defeated the Lancastrians, killed their leader, Edmund Beaufort and captured King Henry VI. The Lancastrians recaptured the King at the Second Battle of St Albans on 12\\xa0February 1461. While he was a prisoner of the Yorkists, in 1459, Henry VI kept Easter at St Albans Abbey. He gave his best gown to the prior, but the gift seems to have been regretted and the treasurer later bought it back for fifty marks. The Battle of Barnet took place on 14\\xa0April 1471. Neville the Kingmaker advanced on London. He camped on Hadley Green, and King Edward IV\\'s army met him there. After confusion in the early morning mist, in which the Yorkists seem to have ended up fighting each other, the Lancastrians won the battle. The Kingmaker was captured and executed, and Edward\\'s authority was never again seriously challenged. England\\'s oldest surviving pub is in Hertfordshire and dates to this period. Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, which is in St Albans, was rebuilt in 1485. Some of the foundation stones are even older, allegedly going back to the 8th century. One of the first three printing presses in England was in St Albans. England\\'s first paper mill, which was the property of John Tate, stood in Hertford opposite today\\'s County Hospital from 1494; visited by Henry VII twice and producing a star and circle watermark on some versions of the Papal Bull recognising his right to reign over England. Renaissance. The long Elizabethan peace, and turmoil in Europe, conspired to raise English commercial power during the Renaissance. European refugees also contributed to English wealth. London was the centre of this new power, and Hertfordshire\\'s commerce benefited accordingly. In November 1524, Catherine of Aragon held court at Hertford Castle. On 3\\xa0May 1547, King Edward VI granted his sister Mary the manor and castle of Hertford, tolls from the bridge at Ware, and the manor of Hertingfordbury. Under Mary, who as Queen earned the sobriquet \"Bloody Mary\", three \"heretics\" (that is, protestants who refused to become catholic) were burnt at the stake in Hertfordshire. William Hale, Thomas Fust, and George Tankerville, were executed at Barnet, Ware, and St Albans respectively. In 1554, Queen Mary granted the town of Hertford its first charter for a fee of thirteen shillings and fourpence, due annually at Michaelmas. Queen Elizabeth I lived at Hatfield Palace near Hatfield as a girl. When plague ravaged London, she held parliaments at Hertford Castle in 1564 and 1581. The law courts moved to St Albans for the same reason. During her reign, Hertfordshire was specifically commended for its soldiers\\' efficiency. In the mobilisation of 1588 for the Anglo-Spanish War, the county sent twenty-five lances and sixty light horse to Brentwood, a thousand infantry to Tilbury, a thousand to Stratford-at-Bow, and five hundred to guard Her Majesty\\'s person. The Arms of Hertfordshire were granted next year. In 1602 founder of Hartford (Connecticut), Samuel Stone was born in Fore Street, Hertford. King James I was often in Hertfordshire and had several works carried out in the county. He built Theobalds Park, enclosing a large tract of southern Hertfordshire in a wall. Parts of the wall still exist. He also had a hand in creating the New River, which was the brainchild of Welsh entrepreneur, Hugh Myddelton: an artificial watercourse that predated the building of England\\'s canal network by over a century. James I, who was a confirmed dog-lover, also built a huge kennel (about long) and dog-yard (over half an acre in size) at Royston. He seems to have loved Royston and spent considerable time there, hunting and feasting and enjoying himself—so much so that his favourite dog, Jowler, returned one evening with a note tied to his collar. The note read: \"Good Mr Jowler, we pray you to speak to the King (for he hears you every day and so he doth not us) that it will please His Majesty to go back to London, for else the country will be undone; all our provision is spent already and we are not able to entertain him longer.\" During the civil war, the county was mainly parliamentarian. St Albans was an especially staunch parliamentary stronghold. In the course of this war, deserters and mutineers among the various encamped armies ravaged the Chilterns, plundered Ashridge, rifled Little Gaddesden Church and broke open its tombs. In 1645, a dozen men of Oliver Cromwell\\'s New Model Army were hanged for outrages against the people of the county. In 1647, the parliamentary army, still unpaid after their victory in the First English Civil War, camped on Thriploe Heath near Royston. They wrote to Parliament demanding their pay. This led to a clash between Cromwell\\'s army and the Levellers at Cockbush Field, near Ware, on 15 November 1647. Cromwell captured and imprisoned the Levellers\\' \"agitators\" and a number were sentenced to death, though only one was actually executed. After the Great Fire of London, many children were sent to Hertfordshire: 62 were sent to Ware, and 56 to Hertford. A few years later the mayor and people of Hertford petitioned King Charles II to confirm, amend and expand the town\\'s charters. Enquiries were made as to whether anyone would object, and three prominent men did, but the attorney general dismissed their objections on grounds of malice in 1680. The town henceforth had its own coroner, who doubled as the town clerk, and both the court-day and market-day were changed so as not to coincide with nearby markets at Ware, Hoddesdon or Hatfield. In 1683, there was a plot to assassinate Charles II and his brother as he passed through Rye House in Hertfordshire. Unfortunately for the plotters, the Royal party was early, so the opportunity was missed; when the plot was discovered, it became a pretext for a purge of the Whig leaders. Modern era. In the last two centuries, Hertfordshire\\'s population has multiplied tenfold. Around the end of the 18th century, its population was around 95,000. In 1821, it was just under 130,000. In 1881 it was just over 203,000, and by 1921 it was just over 333,000. By the 2001 census, it was 1,033,977. During the 18th century brewing became an important industry in Hertfordshire. Smallpox broke out in Hertford gaol in 1729, and spread into the town. The next year, smallpox hit Hitchin, killing 158 people. The River Lea Navigation Act of 1739 led to the river being improved, becoming navigable as far as Ware. Locks were built in Ware, Broxbourne, and \"Stanstead\" (presumably Stanstead Abbotts rather than Stansted Mountfitchet, which is not on the Lea). By 1797, the Grand Junction Canal (now called the Grand Union Canal) was being cut. Its highest point is the Tring Summit in Hertfordshire, which was formed in 1799. Because a canal barge can hold so much more than a wagon, the waterways expansions increased the quantity of supplies that could reach London (and the amount of refuse and manure that could be carted away). Mobilisation for the Seven Years\\' War affected Hertfordshire. In 1756, £350 was paid to the inns and public houses of Ware for the troops staying with them. The next year, Pitt\\'s army reforms made Hertfordshire liable to provide 560 officers and men. The county also contributed soldiers to the French Revolutionary Wars. On 7\\xa0May 1794, lists opened for the Hertfordshire Yeomanry Cavalry Regiment, which comprised five troops of cavalry. The Loyal Hemel Hempstead Volunteers formed in 1797. Two further troops of volunteers were raised in 1798, at Borehamwood and Sawbridgeworth, and the same year, the Hitchin Volunteers were also raised, but their duty was only to defend land within of Hitchin. In 1795, a Dr Walker wrote a report on agriculture and forestry in the county. He said \"Herts is justly deemed the first and best corn county in the kingdom\", an assessment that may not be free from local bias. It nevertheless shows how more advanced farming techniques and soil improvement programmes had enabled farmers to work Hertfordshire\\'s \"heavier\" soils to better effect since the Saxon–Norse wars. Thanks to a rapidly increasing population and improved record-keeping practices, the volume of paper records for Hertfordshire in the 19th and 20th centuries is huge. Many of these documents are written or printed on paper made locally, at a time when paper-making joined brewing as another dominant industry in the county. In 1809, John Dickinson purchased Apsley Mills in Hemel Hempstead for his newly patented paper-making machine. In a dispute with the Society of Paper-Makers in 1821, he dismissed the men involved and trained replacements. By 1825, Apsley and Nash Mills in Hemel Hempstead were using steam power to produce paper. Dickinson patented his silk threadpaper in 1829, which was used, among other things, for Exchequer Bonds, and had to be made under supervision from two excise men. He built Croxley Mills, near Rickmansworth, in 1830 and Abbots Hill, Nash Mills, in 1836. In 1840, the Uniform Penny Post came in. Dickinson made paper for the stamps, and also for the Mulready envelopes. He built a private gas works at Apsley in 1851. In March 1886, John Dickinson & Co. Ltd. was incorporated with £500,000 in capital and of glass houses. By 1900, the company had of glass houses in the Cheshunt area. Rothamsted Research, previously known as the Experimental Station and then the Institute of Arable Crops Research, is one of the oldest agricultural research institutions in the world, at its Harpenden site. It was founded by a fertiliser inventor in 1843. The 19th century was also a busy period for the military. Ten corps of Volunteer Infantry were formed in 1803. In 1804, the clock tower in St Albans signalled news of the Battle of Trafalgar by semaphore. The Duke of Wellington earned the freedom of the borough of St Albans after Napoleon\\'s defeat in 1814. The Hertfordshire Regiment became the fourth battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment in 1891, and in March 1900, the 42nd (Hertfordshire) Company of the Imperial Yeomanry landed at Cape Town. Cecil Rhodes, who founded De Beers and the state of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), was born in South Street, Bishops Stortford, in 1853. The house is still standing, and has been adapted into a museum. He spent much of his youth in South Africa, but returned to Bishops Stortford in 1873. The first branch railway line in England was the Aylesbury one, which opened in 1839. It had a station in Hertfordshire, at Marston Gate. Another rail line grew out from London towards Cambridge, reaching Broxbourne in 1840, Harlow in 1841, and Bishops Stortford in 1842. A branch to Hertford opened in 1843. The first Hatfield train crash took place on Boxing Day, 1870. The London Underground rail line reached Rickmansworth in 1887. Twentieth century. Pre World War II. The two flagship garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn were central to the development of town planning in England. The first Garden City Company formed in 1903, with £300,000 of capital, and by 1914, Letchworth had a population of around 10,000. Ebenezer Howard bought nearly in 1919, and the first house in Welwyn Garden City was occupied in 1920. The town\\'s official date of founding was 29\\xa0April. In the First World War, the Hertfordshire Yeomanry mobilised in September 1914 and were almost immediately deployed to Egypt. The 2nd London Division of the Territorial Force had their headquarters at St Albans, and the North Midland Territorial Division was billeted there as well. The 1/1st Hertfordshire Regiment landed at Le Havre in November, and saw action in the Ypres Salient that month. The Hertfordshire Volunteer regiment formed on 15\\xa0May 1915. On 13\\xa0October of that year, a Zeppelin raid hit North Road in Hertford, destroying houses there. In 1916, the Hertfordshire Regiment was transferred to 39th Division and fought at St Julien. Two Victoria Crosses (\"VC\") were awarded to Hertfordshire men in 1916: one to Corporal Alfred Alexander Burt and one to Lieutenant William Leefe Robinson, who shot down the first German airship of WWI, a Schutte-Lanz over Cuffley. Second Lieutenant Wulfstan Tempest shot down a Zeppelin on 2\\xa0October of that year, and it came down in Potters Bar. The 1st Battalion of the Hertfordshire Regiment fought near Achiet-le-Grant in 1918, and then at the Battle of Havrincourt. It also fought in the advance to Ghissignies. Hertfordshire\\'s last VC of the First World War was awarded in December 1918, after the war had finished: a posthumous VC for Lieutenant Frank Young of Hitchin, who was killed on 18\\xa0September 1918, aged 23. With the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Hertfordshire Regiment were mobilised. Together with the 6th Battalion of the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment, they made up 162nd Infantry Brigade of the East Anglian Division. Second Battalion would later be at Ver-sur-Mer in Normandy in support of the D-Day landings. In May 1940, a public meeting at County Hall, Hertford (which was then newly built, having only opened in 1939) was held to consider forming the Hertfordshire Local Defence Volunteers. Nineteen companies formed at once. They became the Hertfordshire Home Guard in December of that year. In 1942 the 191st (Hertfordshire and Essex Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery formed for an anticipated campaign in Northern Europe. Hertfordshire was central to aircraft manufacture in the Second World War. De Havilland designed their Mosquito in Hatfield and constructed them at Leavesden, together with Halifax bombers. Many RAF pilots were trained at Panshanger. From 1940, No. 2 (AC) Squadron was stationed at RAF Sawbridgeworth, with the purpose of mounting tactical reconnaissance sorties over occupied Europe. Initially it operated the Westland Lysander, before re-equipping with the more capable Curtiss Tomahawk and North American Mustang aircraft. About 4000 bombs, 107 V-1 flying bombs, and 47 V-2 rockets fell on Hertfordshire during the Second World War. American Flying Fortresses bombers of the 398th Bombardment Group (Heavy) mounting 195 combat missions against targets on the Continent from RAF Nuthampstead. The United States Army Air Forces used RAF Bovingdon as a training station, while the US VIII Fighter Command Headquarters was at RAF Bushey Hall. Post-War. After the war, Stevenage was the first town to be redeveloped under the New Towns Act 1946. Hatfield remained closely connected with the aircraft industry, and about 10% of the aircraft workers in England worked in Hertfordshire in the 1960s. The de Havilland Comet was developed in the town. The London Government Act 1963 created an enlarged Greater London in 1965 which took Barnet from Hertfordshire, but in exchange, the county gained Potters Bar and South Mimms from Middlesex. The county\\'s boundaries were revised in the reforms accompanying the Local Government Act 1972, at which time Royston became fully a part of Hertfordshire. Camfield House, Hatfield, belonged to Barbara Cartland during this period, and Beatrix Potter lived there as well. The county\\'s boundaries were revised again in 1993, when Elstree became fully a part of Hertfordshire, gaining some land from Greater London (historically Middlesex). During the Second World War, sculptor Henry Moore moved to the village of Perry Green in Hertfordshire when his former home was bombed. The Henry Moore Foundation still operates from the village. The character of Hertfordshire changed in the later part of the 20th century. In 1992, it was resolved to close the aircraft manufacturing site in Hatfield. At the start of the 20th century, 83% of the workforce were involved in agriculture, but by the end, less than 1% remained so. Only one brewery, McMullens, is still open and there are no remaining commercial maltings or mills. Nowadays, Hertfordshire has become a service and administrative centre containing the head offices of several important companies (see here) and a dormitory for London. A growing trend is research and development, notably for Glaxo and at the University of Hertfordshire which, from relatively humble beginnings as Hatfield Polytechnic, now has over 23,000 students. On 17\\xa0October 2000, a major rail crash took place in Hatfield. Criticism of Railtrack after the accident was rife, and the company had to pay over £700 million in compensation. It ceased trading owing to insolvency in 2002. The fire of 11\\xa0December 2005 at Buncefield, Hemel Hempstead, was a major disaster. Hertfordshire\\'s Chief Fire Officer, Roy Wilsher, said it was \"possibly the largest in peacetime Europe.\" About sixty million gallons of petrol burned, the largest of the explosions measured just under 2.5 on the Richter scale, and the smoke darkened skies in neighbouring towns for two days before it could be extinguished. In a long, gradual decline in agriculture, fishing and forestry, the 2011 census recorded 1,878 Hertfordshire workers employed in this sector. Conservation. Hertfordshire has a larger number of listed buildings and village greens pre-dating 1700 than Greater London, see for example Grade II* listed buildings in Hertfordshire which tend to be in this category. All 10 District (or Borough) Councils have designated conservation areas. Crime and criminals. King Stephen held court at St Albans in 1143. He arrested Geoffrey de Mandeville, who held shrievalty of London, Middlesex and Hertfordshire from the pretender Empress Matilda. De Mandeville surrendered his castles, including the one he had recently built at South Mimms, and went on to become a noted outlaw and bandit. A seventeenth-century highwaywoman, called the \"Wicked Lady\", preyed on travellers on Nomansland Common along Watling Street to the far end of Wales. This may have been Lady Katherine Ferrers of Markyate Cell 1634-1660 who was married to a detached husband Thomas Fanshaw and whose body was carried across the county to be buried at Ware. By the time of an 1840 fire at the large house, a folklore rhyme had arisen:<br> Near the cell there is a well<br> Near the well there is a tree<br> Near the tree the treasure be In one of the last witch trials recorded, Jane Wenham, of Walkern, was convicted of witchcraft in 1712. The accused was over the age of 70 at the time. Queen Anne pardoned Wenham, who \"lived on in a cottage at Gilston\". In 1751, John and Ruth Osborne of Gubblecot, Tring, were accused of witchcraft. A mob dragged them through the village pond until Ruth drowned. One Thomas Colley, a chimney sweep and apparently the ringleader, was hanged; but the people disapproved of the hanging and did not come to watch. There are records for Hitchin court from the 17th century. William Bogdani wrote in 1744: In 1783 the vestry organised a watch to \"put a stop to the daring robberies almost nightly committed in or near the town.\" The next year Vincenzo Lunardi\\'s first balloon flight over Britain landed in Standon Green End where a stone commemorates the achievement. Also in the late 18th Century, Hertford\\'s branch of Woolworth\\'s (now closed) was formerly an inn called the Maiden Head. From this inn, Walter Clibborn, the \"murderous pie man of Hertford\", operated. He pretended to be deaf, so that people would talk freely while he moved among them selling pies, overhearing their destinations and the location of their valuables; and, with his sons who blackened their faces, would ambush them later that night. Clibborn was shot dead in 1782 by one George North on the Datchworth to Branfield road. In 1823, the murder of William Weare in Radlett became known as the first trial by newspaper. The murderer, who was the Mayor of Norwich\\'s son John Thurtell, a notorious gambler, pleaded that the sensational newspaper coverage had prejudiced the court against him. It only took 20 minutes of deliberations for the jury to sentence him to death by hanging. The crowds that gathered for the trial were so large that the judge had trouble getting to the courthouse through the gridlocked streets, and about 15,000 people attended the hanging itself. The murder of Mercy Nicholls in Railway Street, Hertford, in 1899, ultimately led to a major re-organisation of Hertfordshire\\'s police force. Authors of Hertfordshire. Jane Austen (1775–1817) wrote about Hertfordshire. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is set in a fictionalised Hertfordshire. Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626), writer and Lord Chancellor, lived at Gorhambury near St Albans and is buried at St Michael\\'s. J. M. Barrie (1860–1937) based his character Peter Pan on Peter Llewelyn Davies, his friend\\'s son, after visiting their family in Berkhamsted. Dame Juliana Berners (1388-?) was the author of the \"Boke of St Albans\", a guide to hunting, hawking and heraldry, which was printed by Abbey Press in 1486. John Bunyan (1628–1688) was linked to Hitchin, and although he was gaoled outside the county in Bedford, he was a member of the Baptist Church at Kensworth (at that time in Hertfordshire, though now in Bedfordshire). He preached extensively in Hertfordshire. George Chapman (c. 1559 – 1634), a poet and playwright remembered for his translations of the Iliad and the Odyssey, was born in Hitchin and lived there. Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343 – 1400) was Clerk of the Works at Berkhamsted Castle in 1389. Sir Henry Chauncy (1632–1719), known for his \"Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire\" (pub. 1700), was made first Recorder of Hertford in 1680. Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) was educated at Christ\\'s Hospital, Hitchin. William Cowper (1731–1800), poet, was born and lived in Berkhamsted. He was later institutionalised in an asylum in St Albans. Charles Dickens (1812–1870) was often in Hertfordshire (not least to visit his friend Edward Bulwer Lytton, who is mentioned below), and significant elements of his novels are set there. Sir Richard Fanshawe (1608–1666) was born at Ware Park and his memorial tablet is in Ware. E. M. Forster (1879-?) lived at Rook\\'s Nest House between Stevenage and Weston. William Godwin (1756–1836), an anarchist philosopher, was a Chapel Minister in Ware; his feminist wife Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797), author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, gave him a daughter, Mary Shelley (1797–1851), who wrote Frankenstein. Graham Greene (1904–1991) was educated at Berkhamsted Grammar School, where his father was headmaster. Julian Grenfell (1888–1915), the First World War poet, lived in Panshanger. Lady Caroline Lamb (1785–1827) lived at Brocket Hall and wrote \"Glenarvon\" there after her unhappy love affair with Lord Byron. She is buried in Hatfield. Nathaniel Lee (c. 1653 – 1692), poet and playwright, was born in Hatfield where his father was rector. Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803–1873) lived at the family seat of Knebworth House where he often entertained Charles Dickens and Benjamin Disraeli, among others. John Scott, the Quaker poet and writer, moved to Great Amwell in 1740. He gave Amwell its name (after Emma\\'s Well, which is nearby and now dry; the well has part of John Scott\\'s poem \"Emma\" inscribed near it.) Nobel prizewinning playwright George Bernard Shaw lived in Hertfordshire until his death in 1950. Anthony Trollope (1815–1882) lived in Waltham Cross. Thomas Walsingham (?-1422), author of the \"Historia Anglicana\" and chronicler of the Peasants\\' Revolt, was a monk in St Albans Abbey in the early 15th century. Film-making in Hertfordshire. Hertfordshire was the home of the pioneering British film maker Arthur Melbourne-Cooper, who was born in St Albans in 1874. He worked in Hertfordshire (but later what became the London Borough of Barnet), and witnessed the birth of the movies as an assistant/cameraman of Birt Acres (1854–1918). Acres, in 1895, co-developed the first British 35\\xa0mm moving picture camera under the guidance of British engineer R.W. Paul. Cooper, for the next 20 years, made contributions to the British moving picture industry. In 1908 Cooper set up the first permanent cinema in Hertfordshire, the Alpha Picture House in St Albans, and a cinema operated on this site for 87 years; the 1930s cinema building has recently been restored and re-opened as the Odyssey Cinema. Elstree Studios nearby has risen to prominence; landmark films and television that have been produced there include the first and second Star Wars films (chronologically, i.e. Episodes IV and V), Indiana Jones, and Superman, The World\\'s End and British television shows Dancing on Ice, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and Big Brother. Parts of the Harry Potter film series production took place at Leavesden Film Studios. Wild child was filmed in Balls park, Hertford. Nobles and politicians of Hertfordshire. Æthelgifu was a Christian Saxon noblewoman who lived in the county in the late 980s, and her will is an important document for the study of the country as well as the county. It shows that Æthelgifu had three large estates in Hertfordshire. She left much of her land to the monks of St Albans, and her will shows the importance of Hitchin as a legal and administrative centre. Hitchin likely stayed in royal hands into the 10th century. Edward Seymour was appointed Earl of Hertford in 1559. He married Lady Catherine Grey, who was Lady Jane Grey\\'s sister, in 1560. As Catherine was in line for the throne, she needed Queen Elizabeth\\'s permission to wed, and because this was not sought, the marriage was held in secret with Edward\\'s sister, Lady Jane Seymour, as the only witness. However, when Catherine became visibly pregnant, she had little option but to reveal her marriage and, at her request, Lord Robert Dudley told the Queen. An angry Elizabeth had the Earl and Countess of Hertford interned in the Tower of London and annulled their marriage. Sarah Churchill, one of the most influential women in English history, was born as Sarah Jennings in St Albans in 1660. She married the Duke of Marlborough, rose to high favour with Queen Anne, then fell out with the queen and was dismissed, but returned to court after the queen\\'s death. She argued with many important people in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, grew very rich, toured the continent and built Blenheim Palace. Winston Churchill and Diana, Princess of Wales, were both descended from her. A new title, the Earl of St Albans, was created in 1628 with a short and undistinguished history, effectively wiped out in the civil war shortly thereafter. Rather than revive the Earldom, Charles Beauclerk, illegitimate son of King Charles II and Nell Gwyn, was made \"Duke\" of St Albans in 1684. This peerage is as of on its fourteenth duke. Robert Arthur Gascoyne Talbot Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, was born at Hatfield House on 3 February 1830. He also died there, 73 years later. In a distinguished political career, he would go on to become the Prime Minister three times and Foreign Secretary four times. William Lamb, (Viscount) Melbourne and again Prime Minister, lived in Hertfordshire and at one stage was its co-Member of Parliament. He died at Brocket Hall. After the Local Government Act 1888, the first County Councillors in Hertfordshire were elected on 17 January 1889. Arthur Balfour, though born in Scotland, was educated in Hertfordshire before going to university at Cambridge. He served as MP for Hertford before being elected as Prime Minister in 1902. He resigned as Prime Minister in 1905, at which time he was the first Prime Minister to own a car. He later served as Foreign Secretary, when his Balfour Declaration was an important episode in the leadup to the creation of Israel.',\n",
       " 'Paul John Flory (June 19, 1910 – September 9, 1985) was an American chemist and Nobel laureate who was known for his work in the field of polymers, or macromolecules. He was a leading pioneer in understanding the behavior of polymers in solution, and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 \"for his fundamental achievements, both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of macromolecules\". Biography. Personal life. Flory was born in Sterling, Illinois, on June 19, 1910. He was raised by Ezra Flory and Nee Martha Brumbaugh. His father worked as a clergyman-educator, and his mother was a school teacher. He first gained his interest in science from Carl W Holl, who was a professor in chemistry. Holl was employed in Indiana at Manchester College as a chemistry professor. In 1936, he married Emily Catherine Tabor. He and Emily had three children together: Susan Springer, Melinda Groom and Paul John Flory, Jr. They also had five grandchildren. All of his children pursued careers in the field of science. His first position was at DuPont with Wallace Carothers. He was posthumously inducted into the Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame in 2002. Flory died on September 9, 1985, due to a massive heart attack. His wife Emily died in 2006 aged 94. Schooling. After graduating from Elgin High School in Elgin, Illinois in 1927, Flory received a bachelor\\'s degree from Manchester College (Indiana) (now Manchester University) in 1931 and a Ph.D. from the Ohio State University in 1934. He completed a master\\'s degree in organic chemistry under the supervision of Prof. Cecil E Boord. Flory then pursued his doctorate thesis in physical chemistry studying the photochemistry of nitric oxide, supervised by Prof. Herrick L. Johnston. Work. In 1934, after receiving his Ph.D., he joined the Central Department of Dupont and Company working with Wallace H. Carothers. After the death of Carothers in 1937, Flory was involved for two years at the Basic Research Laboratory located in the University of Cincinnati. During World War II, there was a need for research to develop synthetic rubber, so Flory joined the Esso Laboratories of the Standard Oil Development Company. During 1943 to 1948 was the Research Laboratory of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. In fact, he was the director of research at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, leading the team for studies on polymers. After working in the industry, Flory left to work at Cornell University for a lectureship. The lectureship was with the George Fisher Baker Non-Residents. During the lectureship, Flory was able to study and understand a way to treat the effect of the excluded volume. According the nobelprize.org polymers, \"would be nonasymptotic with the length of the chain, that is the fear of the contribution by the exclusion of the segment of the chain from the space occupied would increase without a limit as the chain is lengthened. This was the volume on the configuration of polymer chains. In 1957, Flory and his family decided to make the move to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The reason he and his family moved from New York to Pennsylvania was for him to be able to develop a program of basic research in chemistry at the Carnegie Mellon Institute. After his work at the Carnegie Mellon Institute, he accepted a professorship position at Stanford University in the department of chemistry. While he was at Stanford University, he changed his direction of research. The change of view in his studies has to do with the spatial configuration having to do with chain molecules. This have to do with configuration treatments having to do with chain molecules. The treatment is the dependent properties through mathematical methods. Not only is mathematical methods the only treatment but so is the thermodynamics of solutions. After his retirement he Flory remained still very active in the world of chemistry. He was a consultant for Dupont and IBM, not long after he retired. Flory also was involved with the study of the foundations in the Soviet Union started off by the professor MV Volkenstein and his collaborators. He also worked with the late professor of Kazuo Nagai in Japan. He felt the need to fight for scientists who were oppressed in various countries. In addition, he also spoke as the \"Voice of America\", during a broadcast in Eastern Europe as well as Soviet Union. Flory also worked for the \"Committee on Human Rights\" which is known as the National Academy of Sciences from 1979 to 1984. During 1980, he worked as a delegate at the scientific forum in Hamburg. Research. After receiving his doctorate in 1934, he dealt with a variety of issues with physical chemistry. This having to do with the kinetics and mechanisms of polymeric substances. Having to do with the distribution of molar mass, solution of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics. In addition, during 1934, he also was able to discover that when polymeric chains will keep growing if they are mixed with other molecules when present. Flory also discovered the understanding of the term \\'theta.\\' In other words, is the constant of hydrodynamic. With the theta point that is the neutral volumes interactions. In conclusion to the development of the theta point it has been confirmed and studied in a variety of laboratories by many scientists. Both natural and synthetic polymers have been studied throughout the theta point. Throughout this a better understanding of macromolecules was provided. It helped with the creation of basis under rational interpretations of physical measurements. The measurements have relations to both the solutions of polymers and quantitative characteristics. Some work completed by Paul Flory during his time includes the development in the quantitative correlations between the chain molecules and chemical structure of properties. This has to do with the way polymers are composed and what are composed of polymers. One piece of material formed through polymers is plastic. In the mid-1930s, Flory discovered how polymers are dissolved in a solvent. Leading to becoming outstretches which is caused by the forces of both polymers and solvent parts. He even had part finding a solution to polymers. Career and polymer science. Flory\\'s earliest work in polymer science was in the area of polymerization kinetics at the DuPont Experimental Station. In condensation polymerization, he challenged the assumption that the reactivity of the end group decreased as the macromolecule grew, and by arguing that the reactivity was independent of the size, he was able to derive the result that the number of chains present decreased with size exponentially. In addition polymerization, he introduced the important concept of chain transfer to improve the kinetic equations and remove difficulties in understanding the polymer size distribution. In 1938, after Carothers\\' death, Flory moved to the Basic Science Research Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati. There he developed a mathematical theory for the polymerization of compounds with more than two functional groups and the theory of polymer networks or gels. This led to the Flory-Stockmayer theory of gelation, which equivalent to percolation on the Bethe lattice and in fact represents the first paper in the percolation field. In 1940 he joined the Linden, NJ laboratory of the Standard Oil Development Company where he developed a statistical mechanical theory for polymer mixtures. In 1943 he left to join the research laboratories of Goodyear as head of a group on polymer fundamentals. In the Spring of 1948 Peter Debye, then chairman of the chemistry department at Cornell University, invited Flory to give the annual Baker Lectures. He then was offered a position with the faculty in the Fall of the same year. He was initiated into the Tau chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma at Cornell in 1949. At Cornell he elaborated and refined his Baker Lectures into his magnum opus, \"Principles of Polymer Chemistry\" which was published in 1953 by Cornell University Press. This quickly became a standard text for all workers in the field of polymers, and is still widely used to this day. Flory introduced the concept of excluded volume, coined by Werner Kuhn in 1934, to polymers. Excluded volume refers to the idea that one part of a long chain molecule can not occupy space that is already occupied by another part of the same molecule. Excluded volume causes the ends of a polymer chain in a solution to be further apart (on average) than they would be were there no excluded volume. The recognition that excluded volume was an important factor in analyzing long-chain molecules in solutions provided an important conceptual breakthrough, and led to the explanation of several puzzling experimental results of the day. It also led to the concept of the theta point, the set of conditions at which an experiment can be conducted that causes the excluded volume effect to be neutralized. At the theta point, the chain reverts to ideal chain characteristics – the long-range interactions arising from excluded volume are eliminated, allowing the experimenter to more easily measure short-range features such as structural geometry, bond rotation potentials, and steric interactions between near-neighboring groups. Flory correctly identified that the chain dimension in polymer melts would have the size computed for a chain in ideal solution if excluded volume interactions were neutralized by experimenting at the theta point. Among his accomplishments are an original method for computing the probable size of a polymer in good solution, the Flory-Huggins Solution Theory, and the derivation of the Flory exponent, which helps characterize the movement of polymers in solution. The Flory convention. In modeling the position vectors of atoms in macromolecules it is often necessary to convert from Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to generalized coordinates. The Flory convention for defining the variables involved is usually employed. For an example, a peptide bond can be described by the x,y,z positions of every atom in this bond or the Flory convention can be used. Here one must know the bond lengths formula_1, bond angles formula_2, and the dihedral angles formula_3. Applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates will describe the same three-dimensional structure using the Flory convention. Awards and Honors. Flory was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1953 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957. In 1968, he received the Charles Goodyear Medal. He also received the Priestley Medal and the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1974. He received the Carl-Dietrich-Harries-Medal for commendable scientific achievements in 1977. Flory received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 \"for his fundamental achievements both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of the macromolecules.\" Additionally in 1974 Flory was awarded the National Medal of Science in Physical Sciences. The medal was presented to him by President Gerald Ford. This award was given to him because of his research on the \"formation and structure of polymeric substances\". Published books. With over 300 writings, both published and unpublished, throughout his lectureship at the university with the research and teaching led to his first published book. The book published by Cornell University was called the \"Principles of Polymer Chemistry.\" The book was then the basis use of information for undergrad students. It was the standard principle for many decades, used by many professors. Another book which was published by Flory was \"Statistical Mechanics of Chain Molecules.\" The book was published in 1969, worked to summarize different parts both molecules theories and applications. In 1985, the book written by Paul Flory called, \"Selected Works of Paul Flory.\" This summarized much of his work and studies.',\n",
       " 'The education system in Switzerland is very diverse, because the constitution of Switzerland delegates the authority for the school system mainly to the cantons. The Swiss constitution sets the foundations, namely that primary school is obligatory for every child and is free in state schools and that the confederation can run or support universities. The minimum age for primary school is about six years in all cantons but Obwalden, where it is five years and three months. After primary schools, the pupils split up according to their abilities and intentions of career paths. Roughly 25% of all students attend lower and upper secondary schools leading, normally after 12 school years in total to the federal recognized matura or an academic Baccalaureate which grants access to all universities. The other students split in two or more school-types, depending on the canton, differing in the balance between theoretical and practical education. It is obligatory for all children to attend school for at least 9 years. The first university in Switzerland was founded in 1460 in Basel, with a faculty of medicine. This place has a long tradition of chemical and medical research in Switzerland. In total, there are 12 Universities in Switzerland; ten of them are managed by the cantons, while two federal institutes of technology, ETHZ in Zurich and EPFL in Lausanne, are under the authority of the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation. In addition, there are seven regional associations of Universities for Applied Sciences (\"Fachhochschulen\") which require vocational education and a special \"Berufsmatura\", or a \"Fachmatura\" (a graduation by a \"Fachmittelschule\") to study. Switzerland has a high rate of foreign students in tertiary education including one of the highest in the world of doctoral level students. Many Nobel prizes have been awarded to Swiss scientists. More recently Vladimir Prelog, Heinrich Rohrer, Richard Ernst, Edmond Fischer, Rolf Zinkernagel, Didier Queloz, Michel Mayor, Kurt Wüthrich, and Jacques Dubochet have received nobel prizes in the sciences. In total, 113 Nobel Prize winners stand in relation to Switzerland and the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded nine times to organizations residing in Switzerland. Geneva hosts the world\\'s largest particle physics laboratory, the CERN. Other important research centers are the Empa and Paul Scherrer Institute which belong to the ETH domain. Primary. The obligatory school system usually includes primary education (\"Primarschule\" in German, \"école primaire\" in French, \"scuola primaria / elementare\" in Italian and \"scola primara\" in Romansh) and secondary education I (\"Sekundarschule\" or \"Sekundarstufe I\" in German, \"secondaire I\" in French and \"scuola secondaria / media\" in Italian and \"scola secundar\" in Romansh). Before that, children generally go to \"Kindergarten\", with one or two years is required in most cantons. In the Canton of Ticino, an optional, third year is available for three-year-old children. In some German speaking cantons kindergarten and the first one or two years may be combined into a \"Grundstufe\" or \"Basisstufe\" where they are all taught together in a single class. In French speaking cantons kindergarten is combined into a four-year \"cycle primaire 1\" or \"cycle 1\" which is followed by a four-year \"cycle primaire 2\" or \"cycle 2\" which completes their primary school. The minimum age for primary school is about six years in all cantons but Obwalden, where it is five years and three months. The cantons Thurgau and Nidwalden allow five-year-olds to start primary school in exceptional cases. Primary school continues until grade four, five or six, depending on the school/canton. Any child can take part in school if they choose to, but pupils are separated depending on whether they speak French, German or Italian. At around age 11–12, depending on which canton in Switzerland the child goes to school in, there \"could\" be a screening exam to decide how to separate the students for secondary school. Some cantons have a system of examination in the second semester of the final year of primary school, some cantons have an exam in second semester and continuous evaluation in both first and second semesters. In some cases, parents or legal guardians of the child are also asked for their recommendations (see Indicator C below) along with a self-evaluation done by the child. Parents\\' recommendation in combination with child\\'s self-evaluation is called the third indicator (Indicator C) for evaluating the student, the first being teacher\\'s evaluation (Indicator A), the second the results of tests (Indicator B) held in first semester. The fourth criterion is the final exam that takes place in the middle of the second semester of the final year primary school (usually held before Easter Break). Secondary. At the end of primary school (or at the beginning of secondary school), pupils are separated (see Indicator C for Fribourg under Primary School) according to their capacities and career-intentions in several (often three) sections for a period of 2–3 years (\"Sekundarschule\") in either Pre-higher secondary school section, General section, or Basic section (Basic may be called \"Realschule\" in German or \"Classe d\\'exigence de base\" in French). Students who aspire for an academic career enter \"Mittelschule\" (also named \"Gymnasium\", or \"Kantonsschule\", a public school by the canton/state) to be prepared for further studies and the Matura (normally obtained after 12 or 13 years of school usually at the age of 18 or 19). Students intending to pursue a trade or vocation complete three to four additional years before entering Vocational Educations which are regulated by federal law and are based on a cooperation of private business offering educational job-positions and public schools offering obligatory school-lessons complementary to the on-the-job education. This so-called \"dual system\" splitting academic and vocational training has its continuation in the higher education system. While the academic training leads to the matura and free admission to universities, successfully completed vocational education gives access to third level of practical education, the \"Höhere Fachschule (Schweiz)\". If in addition to the vocational training the \"Berufsmaturitätsschule\" is completed the Fachhochschule may be visited instead. Rather recently introduced is a third, middle path via the Fachmittelschule which leads to a direct access to a \"Fachhochschule\" after a successful graduation of a \"Fachmatura\". In some cantons, students with a \"Fachmatura\" may also get access to universities after a successful additional year. In the science literacy assessment of PISA, 15-year-old students in Switzerland had the 16th highest average score of 57 countries. In the lower second level, there are several different teaching and school models that may exist. Some cantons define a specific model, while others allow the individual municipalities to determine which model to follow. Separated model. Pupils are allocated to institutionally separate school types, according to their performance levels. The structure is based on the principle of equal capacities among pupils. Generally, each school type has its own adapted curricula, teaching material, teachers and, in some cases, its own range of subjects. In general, there are 2 to 3 school types (4 in a minority of cantons), the names of which vary. In the structure with 2 school types, a distinction is made between the performance-based group at basic level (with the least demanding requirements), and the performance-based group at advanced level. In the structure with 3 school types, there is a performance-based group at basic level, a performance-based group at intermediate level and a performance-based group at advanced level. The requirements of the performance-based group at advanced level are the most demanding and this school type generally prepares pupils for transfer to the matura schools. Cooperative model. The cooperative model is based on core classes with different performance requirements. Each pupil is assigned to a core class according to his or her performance level. The pupils attend lessons in certain subjects in differentiated requirement-based groups (whereby the core classes are mixed). Integrated model. The integrated model does not use different school types or core classes. Pupils with different performance levels attend the same class and mixing is maintained. In certain subjects, teaching occurs on differentiated requirement-based levels. International education. As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed Switzerland as having 105 international schools. ISC defines an \\'international school\\' in the following terms \"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country\\'s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\" This definition is used by publications including The Economist. Switzerland was the birthplace of the International Baccalaureate in 1968 and 50 schools in Switzerland offer one or more of the IB programmes (Primary, Middle Years, Diploma and Career-related Programmes). Tertiary. Tertiary education depends on the education chosen in secondary education. For students with a matura, university is the most common one. Apprentices who attended a vocational high school will often add a Fachhochschule or a Höhere Fachschule to their curriculum. There are 14 public and generic universities in Switzerland, 10 of which are maintained at cantonal level and usually offer a range of non-technical subjects. Of the remaining 4 institutions, 2 are run by the Swiss Confederation and are known as \"Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology\". Switzerland is well known for its advanced business education system. A number of world-class universities and MBA programmes, such as the International Institute for Management Development, HEC Lausanne, University of St. Gallen, Kalaidos FH and University of Zurich belong to that category. All of them are also registered in the Financial Times ranking. See also the list of universities in Switzerland. Switzerland has a high rate of international students. In 2013, 16.9% of the total tertiary enrollment in Switzerland came from outside the country, a rate that is the 10th highest of the 291 countries included in the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This rate was just higher than Austria (16.8) and just lower than the United Kingdom (17.5). However, due to the much smaller tertiary system in Switzerland their 47,000 foreign tertiary enrollments are dwarfed by much larger countries such as the United States (740,000), the United Kingdom (416,000), France (228,000) and Germany (196,000). Many international students attend Swiss universities for advanced degrees. In 2013 masters programs enrolled about 27% foreign students (fourth highest rate) and doctoral programs were 52% foreign (second behind Luxembourg). Switzerland also has a high rate of PhD students and inhabitants with doctoral degrees. In 2014 Switzerland had the highest rate of inhabitants (2.98%) with doctoral degrees in the world. In 2010, with 2.5%, Switzerland had the second-highest rate of inhabitants with doctoral degrees in Europe. In 2008, the number of students graduating with a PhD was 3209 (up from 2822 in 2000) of which 45% were foreigners (up from 31% in 2000). Educational rankings. In 1995 Switzerland took part in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) assessment. TIMSS is an international assessment of the mathematics and science knowledge of fourth- and eighth-grade students around the world. It was developed by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) to allow participating nations to compare students\\' educational achievement across borders. In 1995, Switzerland was one of forty-one nations that participated in the study. They did not participate in later studies. Among 8th graders, Switzerland ranked 15th overall, 8th in math and 25th in science. A National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) study that used the TIMSS assessment among 12th graders found similar results. The Swiss students were in their upper secondary education and were attending either a gymnasium, general education, teacher training or advanced vocation training. In math, the Swiss scored a 540 (the average score was 500), and were 3rd out of 21. Their science score was 523, which was 8th out of 21. In physics, they scored 488 (the average was 501) and were tied for 9th place out of 16. The advanced mathematics score was 533 which was 3rd out of 16. The World Economic Forum\\'s Global Competitiveness Report for 2010-11 ranked Switzerland as first overall. Under the fifth pillar of the report, \"Higher education and training\", the Swiss had a score of 5.79, which is the fourth highest among all the countries surveyed. According to one EPFL source, globally, 4 out of the 20 top labs in the field of AI are located in Switzerland. Cantonal school systems. While compulsory schooling in Switzerland is between 9 and 11 years long, many of the specifics of the system vary by canton. In most cases, kindergarten lasts 1 to 2 years, primary level lasts 6 years, and the lower secondary level 3 years. In Ticino, there is a third, non-mandatory, kindergarten year, primary lasts 5 years, followed by 4 years of lower secondary. In some German speaking cantons kindergarten and the first one or two years may be combined into a \"Grundstufe\" or \"Basisstufe\" where they are all taught together in a single class. In the French speaking cantons (FR, GE, JU, NE, VD, VS) kindergarten is combined with primary to create 2 primary levels, each 4 years long. In 17 cantons, it is compulsory to attend pre-school. In almost all cantons, the municipalities are obliged to provide at least one year of pre-school classes. This table shows the school system for 2017/2018 and how the lower secondary schools are organized: Education demographics. During the 2008-2009 school year there were 1,502,257 students in the entire Swiss educational system. In kindergarten or pre-school, there were 152,919 students (48.6% female). These students were taught by 13,592 teachers (96.0% female) in 4,949 schools, of which 301 were private schools. There were 777,394 students (48.6% female) in the obligatory schools, which include primary and lower secondary schools. These students were taught by 74,501 teachers (66.3% female) in 6,083 schools, of which 614 were private. The upper secondary school system had 337,145 students (46.9% female). They were taught by 13,900 teachers (42.3% female) in 730 schools, of which 240 were private. The tertiary education system had 234,799 students (49.7% female).

       " 'The University of Lagos, popularly known as UNILAG, is a public research university located in Lagos, Nigeria and was founded in 1962. UNILAG is one of the first generation universities in Nigeria and is ranked among the top universities in the world in major education publications. The university presently has three campuses in the mainland of Lagos. Whereas two of its campuses are located at Yaba (the main campus in Akoka and the recently created campus at the former school of radiography), it\\'s college of medicine is located at Idi-Araba, Surulere. Its main campus is largely surrounded by the Lagos lagoon and has 802 acres of land. The University of Lagos currently admits over 9,000 undergraduate students annually and enrolls over 57,000 students. A visitation panel, created to look into the affairs of the university between 2016 and 2020 detected cases of financial abuses from top officials and ordered the university to close accounts with commercial banks. On 7 October 2022, Folasade Ogunsola was appointed vice chancellor of the University of Lagos making her the first female to attain such height in the University. History. UNILAG was founded in 1962, two years after the independence of Nigeria from Britain. It was one of the first five universities created in the country, now known as \"first generation universities\". Eni Njoku was appointed as the first black vice-chancellor of the university in 1962, and he remained in office till 1965 when he was replaced by Saburi Biobaku. However, due to controversy surrounding his appointment, Saburi was stabbed by Kayode Adams, a student radical who believed Biobaku\\'s appointment was unfair and ethnically motivated. On 29 May 2012, the then President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, proposed to rename the University of Lagos to Moshood Abiola University in honour of Moshood Abiola, who died in jail as a political prisoner in 1998. The proposed name change became a subject of protests from students and alumni. The proposal was consequently jettisoned as the Nigerian federal government gave in to the protests incited by the proposed name change. Folasade Ogunsola is the current vice chancellor, she was appointed on 7 October 2022 and assumed office on 12 November 2022. There has been reports of sexual misconduct levelled against several lecturers at the university which the university denied. In 2019, the BBC reported that \"female reporters were sexually harassed, propositioned and put under pressure by senior lecturers at the institutions – all the while wearing secret cameras\". An investigative documentary was produced by former victims of the sexual harassment which was uploaded YouTube. Academics and research. The university has remained one of the most competitive in the country in terms of admissions. With approximately 57,000 students as of 2013, the University of Lagos has one of the largest student populations of any university in the country. The University of Lagos is one of the twenty-five federal universities which are overseen and accredited by the National Universities Commission (NUC). A recent publication of Forbes magazine ranked the school as the third best university in Africa for entrepreneurship after University of Cape Town and Makerere University, tagging University of Lagos the \"startup powerhouse\" college for Nigerian students. The university has been called \"the university of first choice and the nation\\'s pride.\" The university\\'s research activity was one of the major criteria used by the National Universities Commission (NUC) in adjudging the university as the best university in Nigeria at the Nigerian University System Annual Merit Award (NUSAMA) in 2008. The University of Lagos, College of Medicine is associated with Lagos University Teaching Hospital(LUTH).

       " 'The Repository for Germinal Choice (originally named the Hermann J. Muller Repository for Germinal Choice, after Nobel laureate Hermann Joseph Muller) was a sperm bank that operated in Escondido, California from 1980 to 1999. The repository is commonly believed to have accepted only donations from recipients of the Nobel Prize, although in fact it accepted donations from non-Nobelists, also. The first baby conceived from the project was a girl born on April 19, 1982. Founded by Robert Klark Graham, the repository was dubbed the \"Nobel prize sperm bank\" by media reports at the time. The only contributor who became known publicly was William Shockley, Nobel laureate in physics. Management. Robert Graham managed the bank until his death in February 1997 and the responsibilities were passed to Floyd Kimble, a businessman from Ohio who had shown interest in the bank. At the time of Graham\\'s death, the bank claimed to have produced 217 children, none of whom from sperm donated from Graham\\'s initial focus, Nobel Prize winners. When Kimble died in 1998 the combined relatives of both men decided to close down the bank. All sperm samples were destroyed; it remains unclear what happened to the Repository\\'s records. Donors. Although most news articles of the time made much of the Repository\\'s \"Nobel sperm\" standards, in fact the Repository is only known to have stocked the sperm of one Nobelist, William Shockley. Other donors were recruited from among the ranks of scientists and academics Graham and his assistant, Paul Smith, considered to be \"the future Nobel laureates\". Graham\\'s initial attempts to recruit Nobel laureates who lived near the Repository yielded only three volunteers, Shockley among them; however, when the news media began reporting on the existence and intentions of the Repository, two of the laureates broke off their ties to Graham and did not donate. Only Shockley remained, and even he donated only once. Paul Smith was charged with recruiting new donors, and he traveled throughout California, focusing mainly on college campuses, in search of volunteers. Smith later estimated his \"hit rate\" of donors signed up compared to men he invited to be \"six or eight, maybe ten\" out of one hundred. The search was expanded to country-wide, and eventually more donors were recruited, although none of them were – then or currently – Nobel laureates. At the time of his death, Graham had expanded his requirements to allow athletes, artists, and businessmen as donors. One donor named Jason Kaiser, known as Orange Red at the repository, was featured in the 2003 documentary along with Paul Kisak. The documentary was entitled \"Genius Sperm Bank\", which the Discovery Channel broadcast in 2004. The documentary briefly touched upon Kaiser\\'s viewpoints at the time, and reunited him with three of the nine children that reputedly had resulted from his donations. Although not a Nobel laureate, Kaiser did achieve a Master of Science degree in cytogenetics and Kisak was in Mensa, Intertel, the CIA and had an MBA and multiple Engineering degrees. Recipients. As with the Repository\\'s criteria to accept sperm donors, its criteria for women to receive sperm from the bank were not as high as initially reported. Rumors that women were required to be members of Mensa were false; in fact, women did not need to meet any particular intellectual requirement. Essentially, any woman who was married, in good health, and not homosexual was accepted; the only women reported to have been refused sperm were \"one [woman] who took lithium, [and] another who was obese and diabetic.\" Outcomes. Graham\\'s original intention was to monitor the outcomes of children produced through the bank\\'s sperm, and he asked families using the bank\\'s sperm to agree to periodic surveys; however, most recipients showed no interest in sharing information on their children once the procedure was over, and when he sent out a survey to recipient families in the early 1990s, few families responded. Two women who claimed to have been the recipients of Repository sperm and to have raised children born of that sperm responded anonymously to a series of articles in \"Slate\" in 2001. Both stated that their children were extremely intelligent and healthy. A later segment of the same \"Slate\" article reported on the highlights of the lives of fifteen of the resultant children. Of the fifteen, six reportedly had 4.0 GPAs and two were reported to be \"artistically precocious\". Still others were reported to be \"geniuses\" and \"whizzes\" at various disciplines. All the children contacted by \"Slate\" were in good health, except one, who had what his mother described as a \"developmental disability\". In media. Journalist David Plotz wrote several articles on the repository for the online magazine, \"Slate\". Plotz would later write a book about his experiences investigating the repository in the book \"The Genius Factory: The Curious History of the Nobel Prize Sperm Bank\" (2005). Moreover, a documentary, which aired on BBC Horizon in 2006, went over the history of the Repository and various statements made by Graham. The program also featured discussion from another donor, University of Central Oklahoma biology professor James Bidlack. \"The Big Bang Theory\"\\'s pilot episode satirizes the repository when Leonard and Sheldon visit the \"high-IQ sperm bank,\" intending to donate specimens, only to leave after Sheldon suffers a moral crisis over committing \"genetic fraud\" by donating sperm that may not produce the promised genius offspring. Episode 5 of \"This is Life with Lisa Ling\" focused on the sperm bank, interviewing people who donated, people who went to the sperm bank seeking donated sperm, and people who were born as a result. The German novel \"Fast genial\" (\"Almost Genius\") by Benedict Wells tells the story of a fictitious child produced by the sperm bank, who searches for his biological father. References. 9.

       " 'Ilocano literature or Iloko literature pertains to the literary works of writers of Ilocano ancestry regardless of the language used - be it Ilocano, English, Spanish or other foreign and Philippine languages. In Ilocano language, the terms \"Iloko\" and \"Ilocano\" are different. Generally, \"Iloko\" is the language while \"Ilocano\" refers to the people or the ethnicity of the people who speak the Iloko language. Ilocano literature in the Philippines is one of several regional Philippine literatures. It is one of the most active tributaries to the general Philippine literature, next to Tagalog (Filipino) and Philippine Literature in English. History of Iloko literature. Ilocanos are Austronesian-speaking people. Families and clans arrived by viray or bilog, meaning \"boat\". The term Ilokano originates from i-, \"from\", and looc, \"cove or bay\", thus \"people of the bay.\" Ilokanos also refer to themselves as Samtoy, a contraction from the Ilokano phrase sao mi ditoy, \"our language here\". Precolonial to the 19th century. Pre-colonial Iloko literature were composed of folk songs, riddles, proverbs, lamentations called \"dung-aw\", and epic stories in written or oral form. Ancient Ilokano poets expressed themselves in folk and war songs as well as the \"dallot\", an improvised, versified and at times impromptu long poem delivered in a sing-song manner. During the Spanish regime, Iloko poetry was generally patterned after Spanish models. In fact, the earliest known written Iloko poems were the romances translated from Spanish by Francisco Lopez, an Augustinian friar who, in 1621, published his own Iloko translation of the \"Doctrina Cristiana\" by Cardinal Bellarmine, the first book to be printed in Iloko. A study of Iloko poetry could be found in the \"Gramatica Ilokana\", published in 1895, based on Lopez\\'s \"Arte de la Lengua Iloca\", earlier published in 1627, but was probably written before 1606. Some Iloko writers credit Pedro Bucaneg, who collaborated with Lopez in the translation of the Doctrina into Iloko, for having been the first known Ilokano poet, and as the \"Father of Ilokano Poetry and Literature.\" Bucaneg, blind since childhood, authored the popular epic known as \"Biag ni Lam-ang\" (\"Life of Lam-ang\") written in the 17th century. The earliest written form of the epic poem was given by Fr. Gerardo Blanco to Isabelo de los Reyes, who published it in \"El Ilocano\" from December 1889 to February 1890, with Spanish translation in prose, and also reprinted it in his El Folklore Filipino, under the title \"Vida de Lam-ang.\" Ilocano literature developed in many ways. During the 18th century, the missionaries used religious as well as secular literatures among other means to advance their mission of converting the Ilokanos to Christianity. The century also saw the publication of religious works like Fr. Jacinto Rivera\\'s \"Sumario de las Indulgencias de la Santa Correa\" in 1719 and the \"Pasion\", a translation of St. Vincent Ferrer\\'s sermons into Iloko by Fr. Antonio Mejia in 1845. The 19th century likewise saw the appearance of Leona Florentino, who has since been considered by some as the \"National Poetess of the Philippines\". Her poems which have survived, however, appear to the modern reader as being too syrupy for comfort, too sentimental to the point of mawkishness, and utterly devoid of form. Fr. Justo Claudio Fojas, an Ilokano secular priest who wrote novenas, prayerbooks, catechism, metrical romances, dramas, biographies, a Spanish grammar and an Iloko-Spanish dictionary, was Leona Florentino\\'s contemporary. Isabelo de los Reyes, Leona\\'s son, himself wrote poems, stories, folklore, studies, and seemingly interminable religious as well as political articles. The achievement of both Claudio Fojas and de los Reyes is possibly more significant than the critical reader of Iloko literature today is ready to admit. The comedia, otherwise known as the moro-moro, and the zarzuela were presented for the first time in the Ilocos in the 19th century. The comedia, a highly picturesque presentation of the wars between Christians and Muslims, and the zarzuela, an equally picturesque depiction of what is at once melodrama, comic-opera, and the skit interminably preoccupied with the eternal theme of boy-meets-girl-who-always-live-happily-ever-after-against-seemingly-impossible-odds are still as popular today as they were when first staged in the Ilocos. The comedia was scripted from the corridos like \"Principe Don Juan\", \"Ari Esteban ken Reyna Hipolita\", \"Doce Paris\", \"Bernardo Carpio\", \"Jaime del Prado\". Marcelino Mena Crisologo helped popularize the zarzuela based on the culture and tradition of the Ilokanos particularly those in Vigan, Ilocos Sur. So did Pascual Agcaoili y Guerrero (1880–1958) of Ilocos Norte who wrote and staged \"Daguiti Agpaspasukmon Basi,\" and Isaias R. Lazo (1887–1983) of San Vicente, Ilocos Sur who wrote comedia and zarzuela. The year 1892 saw the printing for the first time of the first Iloko novel, written by Fr. Rufino Redondo, an Augustinian friar, titled \"Matilde de Sinapangan.\" Another Iloko novel which was written before the end of the 19th century by one Don Quintin Alcid was \"Ayat, Kaanonto Ngata?\" (\"Love, When Shall it Be?\"). Arturo Centeno of Vigan, Ilocos Sur, also wrote three novels titled \"Apay a Di Mangasawa?\" (\"Why Doesn\\'t He Get Married?\"), \"Dispensara\" and \"Padi a Puraw Wenno Naamo a Kibin\" (\"A White Priest or a Good Guide\"). 21st century literature. The 20th century was comparatively more intense in literary activity. Some of the literature in this period are \"Biag ti Maysa a Lakay, Wenno Nakaam-ames a Bales\" (\"Life of an Old Man, or a Dreadful Revenge\") by Mariano Gaerlan (1909); \"Uray Narigat no Paguimbagan\" (\"Improvement Despite Obstacles\") by Facundo Madriaga (1911); \"Mining Wenno Ayat ti Cararua\" (\"Mining or Spiritual Love\") by Marcelino Peña Crisologo (1914); \"Nasam-it ken Narucbos nga Sabong dagiti Dardarepdep ti Agbaniaga\" (\"Sweet and Fresh Flower of a Traveller\\'s Dreams\") by Marcos E. Millon (1921); \"Sabsabong ken Lulua\" (\"Flowers and Tears\") by R. Respicio (1930); \"Apay a Pinatayda ni Naw Simon?\" (\"Why Did They Kill Don Simon?\") first known detective novel in Iloko by Leon C. Pichay (1935); \"Puso ti Ina\" (\"A Mother\\'s Heart\") by Leon C. Pichay (1936). When the \"Bannawag\" magazine, a sister publication of \"Liwayway\", \"Bisaya\" and \"Hiligaynon\", hit the streets on Nov. 3, 1934, Iloko literature reached a headland. Many Ilokanos started to write literary pieces. The early \"Bannawag\" short stories showed sustained growth. The short stories written in the 1920s were poor imitations of equally poor American fiction. Early short story writers had practically no literary background in their attempts. The growth of the short story was not apparent until \"Bannawag\" resumed publication in 1947. Most of the stories published dealt with themes of war; guerrilla activities, Japanese atrocities, murder, pillage and death. By the latter part of the decade, writers of different ages emerged, and from their ranks came stories that were less verbose, tighter, and with more credible characterization than those written previously. While many articles have been written by Ilokanos and non-Ilokanos about the Ilocos Region, few scholarly studies have been conducted. Among these scholars were Leopoldo Y. Yabes of the University of the Philippines, who made a brief survey of Iloko literature in 1934. His findings showed that Iloko literature began with Pedro Bucaneg. In 1940, Thomas B. Alcid of the University of Santo Tomas made a study on the Iloko prose fiction and discussed the Iloko short story and the Iloko novel and their possibilities in Philippine literature. His study showed that the short stories and novels at that time were still young and needed more improvement. In 1954, Mercedes F. Guerrero of the Manuel L. Quezon Educational Institution (now MLQU) made a masteral thesis titled \"Critical Analysis of the Outstanding Iloco Short Stories Published in the Bannawag from 1948 to 1952.\" Her findings showed that the Iloko stories offer a mine of information about the ideals and customs of the Filipino people. In the display of emotions and feelings, the Iloko author has been free or spontaneous in dealing with the life he portrayed. Most often he has been compassionate with his characters. He has treated a wide variety of subjects that there is no important place of Filipino life that has not been depicted. There are stories on mere trifling matters as well as their own nation-slaking subjects. These are stories about persons, about animals, about places and about events. Guerrero also found out that the Ilokano author served his society by: 1.) Preserving the ideals, customs and traditions of the people. 2.) Bringing out the social consciousness of the era—its mood, conflicts, struggles, and rehabilitation. 3.) Awakening man\\'s sensibilities to the joys, sorrows, loves, hatreds and jealousies of the people. 4.) Casting away sectional sentiments and prejudices and bringing about fuller understanding of the different ethnic groups. A related literature published by Dr. Marcelino A. Foronda, Jr. in 1967, titled \"Dallang: An Introduction to Philippine Literature in Iloko,\" discussed the traits and characteristics of the Ilokanos. Of their literature, he stated: \"...The Ilokano language is so highly developed as to have produced the greatest number of printed works in any Philippine language, next to Tagalog. \"Bannawag\" has played and still plays a major role in the development of Iloko literature. At present, it publishes poems (daniw), short stories (sarita), novels (nobela), essays (salaysay), comics, biographies, folktales and many others including what some call avant garde literary output. It is the only magazine where Ilokano writers hope to publish most of their writings. During the magazine\\'s infancy years in the 1930s, most of its contents were translations from the \"Liwayway\" magazine save a novel by Hermogenes F. Belen titled \"Nadaraan a Linnaaw\" (Blood-stained Dew) which was serialized in 1947. Other writers at that time included Benjamin M. Pascual, David D. Campañano, Godofredo S. Reyes, Benito de Castro, Jose P. Acance, Benjamin Gray, Marcelino A. Foronda, Jr. In the 1960s, poems, short stories and novels published by the Bannawag became better — in craftsmanship, development of plots and themes, among others. Writers by then, most of whom were college students and professionals, had a bigger library of literary books. To help in the development of the Iloko short story, \"Bannawag\" launched a writing contest in 1961. The judges were Prof. Santiago Alcantara of the National University, Prof. Angel C. Anden of the Manuel L. Quezon University, and Dr. Marcelino A. Foronda, Jr. of the De La Salle University-Manila. This contest lasted until 1970. One of the judges said the quality of Iloko short stories was competitive with those written in English. Before the martial-law era, most of the poems, stories and novels dwelt on political unrest and protests, like rallies and demonstrations by students, professionals and workers against the government.\"\"\\'(From an essay by Jose A. Bragado. Bragado is one of the foremost writers in contemporary Ilokano literature. He is a former literary editor of Bannawag magazine and past president of GUMIL, an international association of Ilokano writers.)\" Iloko Literature: Today and Tomorrow. Ilokano writers have also published their works in foreign countries. One of the most popular authors of Ilocano ancestry abroad was the late Carlos Bulosan, a California immigrant born to Ilokano parents in Pangasinan. And currently, the most internationally translated Filipino author is an Ilokano from Rosales, Pangasinan—Francisco Sionil Jose, popularly known as F. Sionil Jose. He is famous for his Rosales saga, a five-novel work about an Ilokano clan, virtually documenting Philippine history from Spanish time to the years of the Marcos administration. The novels, translated in about 22 languages, are circulated and read around the world. Back home, many Iloko writers have won major prizes in the annual Palanca Awards, the most prestigious and most anticipated of all literary contests in the Philippines. These famous winners\\' names include Reynaldo A. Duque, Ricarte Agnes, Aurelio S. Agcaoili, Lorenzo G. Tabin, Jaime M. Agpalo Jr., Prescillano N. Bermudez, William V. Alvarado, Maria Fres-Felix, Clarito G. de Francia, Arnold Pascual Jose, Eden Aquino Alviar, Severino Pablo, Ariel S. Tabag, Daniel L. Nesperos, Roy V. Aragon, Danilo Antalan, Joel B. Manuel, Bernardo D. Tabbada, Noli S. Dumlao and others. Clarito G. de Francia expanded his writings by composing songs in English, when he immigrated to the U.S. His first work \"Fil-Am Song\" deals with the pursuit of Filipino-Americans\\' struggles in the green fields and their triumphs in great cities. This is followed by \"Loyalty for Our Country and Humanity,\" a tribute to America as a sanctuary of migrants. President Barack Obama reacted to this work: \"...We should be proud of what we have accomplished together...It\\'s the optimism and hard work of people like you that have changed our country for the better...\" After that, come \"Today is Your Special\" a birthday greetings; \"Home Sweet Home\" an upliftment of family togetherness; \"Celebrate a Recommitment\" an anniversary song; \"Live and Share Christ to the World\" for evangelization, etc. These pieces show De Francia\\'s way of encouraging his fellow Filipinos to impart their heritage, culture and traditions to the world. As a bridge for this idea, he has been sponsoring a short story writing contest in English, the DEfrancia Awards for Literature(DEAL), since 2017. The GUMIL - Gunglo dagiti Mannurat nga Ilokano.

       " 'Alegría is a municipality in the Usulután department of El Salvador. Overview. Located at approximately 1,200 meters above sea level, the municipality\\'s cool climate lends itself to many thriving local plant nurseries, some of which specialize in tropical flowers such as birds of paradise, anthuriums, orchids, and varieties of bromelias. The town is famous for its volcanic lake, the Alegría Laguna, which is a national protected area managed by the NGO ADESCAM. There is a local myth that a siren or mermaid lives in the lake, and that she will lure men who swim there to their deaths. Rural villages belonging to the municipality include El Zapotillo. Laguna Alegría. In the Sierra of Chinameca, one of the most important volcanoes is Tecapa, located at 26 kilometers away from Usulután, and 2 kilometers to the south of Alegria. Its peak, in the famous plain of Quemela, at 1,603 meters above sea level exhibits a big rocky crater, oval and guided from east to west in whose bottom, in eccentric position to the southeast and at 1,250 meters high, a small crater form lake of yellow-greenish waters exists, resting on mantels of sulfur. The highest part of the crater circumvallation to the northeast is the culminating point of the volcanic cone and the lowest is to the east and at 1,275 meters high. In that area a current of lava was spilled in prehistoric time. The little lagoon is one of the most beautiful places of the country. It was called formerly Tecapa, the same as the volcano, but from recent times it is also denominated \"Laguna de Alegria\", because it is next to the city of the same name. It has thermal sources and fumaroles, mainly in the northwest direction and a circumvallation highway for driven vehicles. In nahuat language the name of Tecapa means \"Lagoon of stones.\" In the skirts of the volcano Tecapa, to the north, are the thermal sources or fumaroles of Bufadero, Tronador, Tronadorcito, Loma China, and El Pinar. Laguna de Alegria is also known as \"America\\'s Emerald\" thanks to Gabriela Mistral nobel prize in literature winner in 1945. In the park of the city of Alegria, the bust in memory of educator Presbytery José Miguel Alegria is erected. He was a remarkable professor of Latin who founded in the town of Tecapa around 1838, a philosophy school. Because of the Law of February 17 of 1891, the city of Tecapa was denominated city of Alegria. This famous professor\\'s body remains in the crypt of this population\\'s parochial church. The current temple of Alegria began being built on August 26, 1870. Alegria is the cradle of the illustrious Salvadoran teacher and thinker don Alberto Masferrer.',\n",

       " 'Juan Martín del Potro (; born 23 September 1988) is an Argentinian retired professional tennis player. Del Potro\\'s biggest achievement is a major title: the 2009 US Open, where he defeated Rafael Nadal in the semifinals and the five-time defending champion Roger Federer in the final. He was the only man outside the Big Three (Novak Djokovic, Federer, and Nadal) to win a major between the 2005 Australian Open and the 2012 US Open, a span of 30 tournaments. Del Potro\\'s other career highlights include reaching the 2018 US Open final, winning an Olympic bronze medal in men\\'s singles at the 2012 London Olympics and the silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, winning Indian Wells in 2018, and leading Argentina to the 2016 Davis Cup title; but his career has also been hampered by a succession of wrist and knee injuries. Del Potro first entered the top 10 of the ATP rankings on 6 October 2008. In January 2010, he reached a then-career-high ranking of world No. 4, after which he withdrew from most of the season due to an injury to his right wrist. In 2016, del Potro led Argentina to its first ever Davis Cup title by defeating Croatia\\'s Marin Čilić in the final from two sets down.

He then made it to the second round of the Australian Open in January, only to retire against David Ferrer due to an injury. Del Potro returned to the circuit in March, winning his first match against Jesse Levine at the Miami Open, before losing in the second round to López. Struggling with injuries, his ranking fell as low as no. 81 in April. \"At the start of the year, I was playing good, but I had many injuries, many problems with my body, with my physique\", said del Potro. \"I changed my coach, changed my physical trainer, I changed everything.\" In May, del Potro had to retire again, this time in a first-round match against Andy Murray at the Rome Masters. During the second set, the Argentine allegedly made derogatory comments about Murray\\'s mother which resulted in a complaint to the umpire. Del Potro\\'s serve was subsequently broken three times in a row, and he suffered a back injury, which caused his retirement. In his second major of the year, the French Open, he was eliminated in the second round by Simone Bolelli in four sets. In June, he reached the semifinals of the Rosmalen Open, losing to eventual winner and top seed David Ferrer in straight sets. For the second year in a row, he was knocked out of Wimbledon in the second round; he won his first-round clash with Pavel Šnobel in straight sets, but then lost to Stanislas Wawrinka. A successful summer followed for the Argentine. In July, del Potro and his team decided to remain in Europe to test his fitness. \"We decided to play on clay courts for my back because if I start to play again on hard courts, maybe I will injure it again\", he recalled. Del Potro won his first career ATP Tour title at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, defeating Gasquet in straight sets in the final. A week later, del Potro reached his second career ATP Tour final at the Austrian Open in Kitzbühel, where he beat local hope and sixth seed Melzer in less than an hour, to claim his second title in two weeks. Having competed in just two clay tournaments all of the 2007 season, he never thought he would win his first two titles on clay courts. In August, del Potro won his third consecutive title at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, beating Andy Roddick in straight sets in the final. After the match, Roddick praised his opponent. \"[Del Potro] hits this way and this way kind of equally and he can hit it from inside out and running to it, which is a good thing for him, bad for the rest of us\". A fourth consecutive title followed a week later in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., where he recorded a victory over Viktor Troicki, becoming the first player in ATP history to win his first four career titles in as many tournaments. \"I don\\'t really understand what I did. It is difficult to believe that I have won four consecutive titles\", del Potro said, crediting coach Franco Davín for his impressive run. \"He changed my game. He changed my mind. He changed everything. When I play and I see him in the stands, it gives me confidence. I can play relaxed.\" At the 2008 US Open, del Potro progressed to the third round, where he won his first match to five sets in the circuit against Gilles Simon to reach the round of 16. He went on to defeat Japanese teenager Kei Nishikori in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, he was stopped by eventual finalist Murray, losing after almost four hours.

He was beaten by Nalbandian again in his next tournament, this time it was in the second round of the Paris Masters. Del Potro blamed fatigue for his defeat, \"It\\'s difficult to play the last tournament of the year. I was tired, my mind was in Argentina [the venue for the Davis Cup final]\". This left del Potro\\'s qualification for the 2008 Tennis Masters Cup out of his hands, but Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat James Blake in the semifinals, which was enough to ensure his place at the year-end event. Del Potro won one match at the Masters Cup, against Tsonga, but lost his other two matches against the higher-ranked Djokovic and Davydenko, meaning that he exited the tournament in the round-robin stage. This was his last event of the year on the ATP Tour. He went on to lose one match in the Davis Cup final, against López, as his team succumbed to a 3–1 loss against Spain. He withdrew from his second match due to a thigh injury and was replaced by José Acasuso.

This was the first time del Potro had defeated Nadal in five meetings. Despite a loss in the semifinals to Murray, del Potro reached a career-high world ranking of No. 5. In the clay-court season, del Potro was eliminated in the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters by Ivan Ljubičić. In Rome, del Potro beat Victor Troicki and Wawrinka to advance to the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by defending champion Djokovic in straight sets.

After defeating Murray for the first time in the quarterfinals, he lost to Federer in the semifinals. At the French Open, where he was fifth seed, del Potro defeated Michaël Llodra, Troicki, Andreev, and ninth seed Tsonga en route to the quarterfinals. He then defeated three-time former quarterfinalist Tommy Robredo to get to his first semifinal of a Grand Slam. He was defeated in a close semifinal, where he was leading by a set twice, by eventual champion Federer who, after their match, said: \"[Del Potro] is young and strong, I have a lot of respect for him.\" Prior to this encounter, del Potro had never taken a set from Federer in their five previous career meetings. At the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, his poor grass-court form from the past continued, as he went down to unseeded Lleyton Hewitt in the second round. In the Davis Cup quarterfinal against the Czech Republic, del Potro won his matches against Ivo Minář and Berdych in straight sets, but Argentina still lost the tie 2–3, eliminating them from the competition.

He then defeated Roddick in the semifinals, saving a match point, to advance to his first Masters 1000 final, and to improve his head-to-head record against Roddick to 3–0. In the final, he lost against Murray in three sets. He later withdrew from the next Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati due to fatigue. Seeded sixth at the US Open, del Potro began by defeating Juan Mónaco and Jürgen Melzer in straight sets, before dropping a set but defeating Köllerer to reach the fourth round. He defeated a resurgent Juan Carlos Ferrero to advance to the quarterfinals for the second consecutive year. Del Potro then advanced to the semifinals by defeating Marin Čilić.

This was his third consecutive victory over Nadal and made him the first Argentine to reach a Grand Slam singles final since Mariano Puerta at the 2005 French Open. In the finals, del Potro rallied from a set and a break down to defeat world No. 1 and five-time defending champion Roger Federer in five sets; his first victory over Federer after six previous defeats, and Federer\\'s first loss in the US Open since 2003. Del Potro stated, \"Since [I was] young, I dream with this and take trophy with me\", said del Potro, who became the first Argentine male to win the title since Guillermo Vilas in 1977. \"I did my dream, and it\\'s unbelievable moment. It\\'s amazing match, amazing people. Everything is perfect.\" After the match, Federer praised del Potro; \"I thought he hung in there and gave himself chances and, in the end, was the better man.\" He is the first player since countryman David Nalbandian to defeat Federer at the US Open, and at 198\\xa0cm (6\\xa0ft 6\\xa0in), he is the tallest ever Grand Slam champion, a record he now shares with Marin Čilić, the 2014 US Open winner, and 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev. Besides Nadal and Djokovic, del Potro is the only player to defeat Federer in a Grand Slam final, and the first player to defeat both Nadal and Federer in the same Grand Slam tournament. Dick Enberg hosted the post-match ceremony, during which a victorious del Potro requested to address his fans in Spanish. Enberg declined the request, saying that he was running out of time, but went on to list the corporate sponsored prizes del Potro won. A couple of minutes later, del Potro made the same request again, and only then did Enberg relent saying, \"Very quickly, in Spanish, he wants to say hello to his friends here and in Argentina.\" An emotional del Potro finally spoke a few sentences in Spanish to a cheering crowd. Many viewers expressed disappointment with Enberg and broadcaster CBS over the interview. A CBS executive later defended Enberg, noting that the contract with the United States Tennis Association required that certain sponsors receive time during the ceremony. In his first match since the US Open, del Potro was upset by world No. 189, Édouard Roger-Vasselin, in straight sets at the Japan Open in Tokyo. He then lost his second straight match to Melzer in the second round at the Masters 1000 event in Shanghai, retiring while trailing in the second set.

Following the Australian Open loss, del Potro missed several tournaments, including the Masters tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami, which were touted as potential return dates, due to the persistent wrist injury. Even though he withdrew from the Monte-Carlo Masters, he regained the world No. 4 ranking, due to Murray\\'s early exit in the second round. He then withdrew from Barcelona and the Rome Masters. On 4 May, del Potro took the option of having an operation to fix the injury.

However, he succumbed yet again to world No. 2, Novak Djokovic, in straight sets. Del Potro then competed at the newly formed Lyon Open, where he defeated lucky loser Quentin Halys, but lost in the next round against Portuguese qualifier Gastão Elias in straight sets. Doubt was cast over his participation at the French Open because of a back injury that had hampered him at Lyon, but he eventually decided to partake in the event. Del Potro entered as the 29th seed, the first time since the 2014 Australian Open that he was seeded at a Grand Slam tournament. In the first round, Del Potro defeated Guido Pella in straight sets, and in the second round against Nicolás Almagro, it was one set apiece before Almagro retired.

In the post match interview he admitted he considered retiring from the match during the second set. The US Open account on Instagram switched his racquet for Thor\\'s hammer using software editing tools, which created a new nickname for the Argentine: Juan Martin \"del Thortro\", by fellow tennis player Roger Federer, adding to a collection of nicknames such as \"Delpo\", \"Tower of Tandil\", \"Palito\" (stick) and \"Enano\" (midget). This led to a joke in social media with Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, and in this joke he demands his hammer back because he claimed to need it for his quests. In the quarterfinals he defeated Roger Federer in four tight sets; his second victory over the Swiss at the US Open, having beaten him in the final in 2009.

However, he was defeated in three sets by John Isner and subsequently declined to be chosen as an alternate for the tournament, instead choosing to rest with his family and friends in his native Tandil. Nevertheless, Del Potro won 730 points in a span of three weeks and reached the 11th spot of the ATP rankings. 2018: First Masters, second US Open final, world No. 3, injuries.

Del Potro then defeated Karen Khachanov and David Ferrer en route to the final, where he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in three sets.

He defeated Richard Gasquet and faced 13th seed Borna Ćorić in the third round, narrowly dropping the first set before he retired due to a knee injury. This injury later forced his withdrawal from the rest of the season and the ATP Finals, for which he had qualified for the first time since 2013. 2019–2021: Continued injuries. Del Potro\\'s injury lingered into the 2019 season, forcing him to withdraw from the Australian Open. He made his comeback at the Delray Beach Open in February where he reached the quarterfinals, losing to Mackenzie McDonald in three sets. Still not having recovered from injury, Del Potro chose not to defend his titles in Acapulco and Indian Wells, withdrawing from both tournaments. Playing in his first tournament back at the Madrid Open, del Potro lost his first match to Laslo Djere. He then played in Rome and secured wins against David Goffin, who had a 3–1 lead over him before the match, and Casper Ruud.

In the French Open, del Potro was seeded eighth but lost in the fourth round to Karen Khachanov. In his first grass-court tournament of the season at Queen\\'s Club, del Potro suffered another career-threatening injury when he fractured his kneecap in his first round match against Denis Shapovalov.

Del Potro has not played any matches since; he dropped out of the singles rankings on 20 June, as well as the doubles rankings on 9 May. 2023: Potential comeback at the US Open. In March, he stated that he would begin training for a potential return at the 2023 US Open. In August, he stated that he wouldn\\'t be able to compete in the tournament, due to his physical state. Playing style. Del Potro is an offensive baseliner with a very powerful serve and a deep, flat, topspin groundstroke, where he pushes his opponents deeper with his heavy groundstroke and trying to blast past them with a winner. His forehand is one of his main strengths and possibly the most powerful in the game, capable of frequently generating speeds more than 160\\xa0km/h. It is widely considered among the top three best forehands on tour by fellow players and analysts, alongside Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Although he possessed a very consistent and powerful double-handed backhand, injury and surgeries on his wrist have rendered his backhand the main weakness in his game. Since his return in 2016, del Potro made tactical changes in his game in order to protect his wrist, like significantly reducing the pace of his two-hander and adopting a one-handed slice. Despite del Potro admitting that relying on slices is \"not my game,\" the shot has been effective in moving his opponents out of position and slowing down rallies enough to allow him to set up powerful offensive shots with his forehand. Furthermore, to compensate for the newfound vulnerability in his backhand wing, del Potro has improved the power and accuracy of his other shots, most notably his serve. Equipment and apparel. Del Potro used the Wilson Hyper ProStaff 6.1 Midplus Stretch early on in his career, and has continued to use this racquet under new paint jobs years later. Del Potro is very superstitious, and after suffering a wrist injury shortly after switching to the Wilson BLX Pro Tour paint job in 2010, he returned to playing with the then outdated Wilson K-Factor 6.1 95 paint job. He particularly favored the exact racquets he had used to win his only Grand Slam title at the 2009 US Open. He again refused to update his racquet to the Wilson BLX Juice Pro in 2012, and in 2014 had only a few K-Factor racquets left. For strings, he uses Luxilon ALU Power strung at 58 lbs. He currently makes use of the same racket painted to resemble the Wilson ProStaff 97. His clothing sponsor is Nike. He used to wear sleeveless shirts, but more recently has worn crew shirts, and often also sports double-wide wristbands and a bandana. For shoes, he wears Nike Air Max Cages. Record against the Big Four. Del Potro has a combined record against all members of the Big Four, which is one of the best in this category. He is also one of the few to have won at least three matches against each of the four. Roger Federer. Del Potro has a record against Roger Federer, and a record in final. Besides the 2009 US Open title, del Potro also captured the 2012 and 2013 Swiss Indoors finals and the 2018 Indian Wells final, while Federer won the 2012 Rotterdam Open and the 2017 Basel Open.

However, in 2013, Djokovic won two of the most important matches between them to date; an epic five-setter at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships semifinals and a thrilling three-setter at the 2013 Shanghai Masters final. In the same year, del Potro defeated Djokovic en route to his second Masters 1000 final, at the 2013 Indian Wells Masters. Del Potro upset Djokovic in the first round at the 2016 Rio Olympics en route to the silver medal. Djokovic defeated Del Potro in three close sets in the final of the 2018 US Open, which was the first grand slam final for Del Potro since his victory at the 2009 US Open. Three of his four victories have come via national representation tournaments. Rafael Nadal. Del Potro has a record against Rafael Nadal. He bested Nadal in the semifinals en route to his 2009 US Open title, which was the first time a player managed to beat both Roger Federer and Nadal in the same Grand Slam tournament (Novak Djokovic subsequently did the same at the 2011 US Open). However, the Spaniard managed to win both times in the Indian Wells Masters encounters, in the 2011 semifinal and the 2013 final. Nadal also won the fourth and last rubber of the 2011 Davis Cup final against the Argentine. Del Potro gained the upper hand at the 2013 Shanghai Masters, defeating Nadal to reach the final where he lost to Djokovic. Del Potro defeated Nadal in a third set tiebreak in the semifinal of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, while Nadal stopped Del Potro\\'s 2017 US Open run, defeating him in a four-set semifinal. In the quarterfinals of 2018 Wimbledon, Nadal came from two sets to one down to defeat Del Potro in an epic five-set match. In their most recent meeting, Del Potro advanced to the final of the US Open when Nadal had to retire, while trailing by two sets to love. Andy Murray. Del Potro has a record against Andy Murray. They only played two finals. The first was in the 2009 Rogers Cup, which was won by Murray.

Díaz was captured by order of the Attorney general\\'s office on 3 October 1997, and was given house arrest after proving he was suffering from Guillain–Barré syndrome. On 11 August 2000, a judge ordered Díaz transferred to jail, considering that his illness had been considerably overcome. When authorities went to his house to complete the transfer, Díaz had escaped and found refuge with an illegal paramilitary group headed by Rodrigo Tovar. During the trial, Díaz was tried as an \"absent inmate\"; the judge concluded that Niño had a great amount of drugs the night she died, but the Attorney General\\'s Office determined that her death had been caused by provoked asphyxiation. The Colombian Bureau of Legal Medicine determined that she had died from pressure put over her mouth and nose. On 20 August 2002, after a year and a half of evading house arrest, Díaz turned himself in to authorities in Valledupar, accompanied by two of his lawyers.

He had already spent a year in jail and had two years pending before his escape. According to the trial, Díaz did not commit unintentional homicide (\"homicidio preterintencional\"), in which the aggressor wants to induce damage but ends up causing death, as the previous judge had ruled. Instead, it was determined that he had committed involuntary manslaughter (\"homicidio culposo\"), which according to Colombian law, is less severe than unintentional homicide. Criticism of trial. Doris Adriana Niño\\'s family, especially her brother Rodrigo, criticized the lenient treatment given to Díaz by authorities as he expressed in statements after Díaz turned himself in: Awards and nominations.

He died in January 1971 in Oslo. U Thant controversy. In 1965, UN Secretary General U Thant was informed by the Norwegian Permanent Representative to the UN that he would be awarded that year\\'s Nobel Peace prize and asked whether or not he would accept. He consulted staff and later replied that he would. At the same time, Jahn, who was Chairman of the Nobel Peace prize committee, lobbied heavily against giving U Thant the prize and the prize was at the last minute awarded to UNICEF. The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to U Thant, for his work in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis, ending the war in the Congo, and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the Vietnam War. The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Jahn effectively vetoing an award to U Thant.',\n",
       " 'Tunisians ( \"Tūnisiyyūn\", \"Twensa\") are the citizens and nationals of Tunisia in North Africa, who speak Tunisian Arabic and share a common Tunisian culture and identity. In addition, a Tunisian diaspora has been established with modern migration, particularly in Western Europe, namely France, Italy and Germany. History. Africa and Ifriqiya. The migrants brought with them their culture and language that progressively spread from Tunisia\\'s coastal areas to the rest of the coastal areas of Northwest Africa, the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands. From the eighth century BC, most of Tunisians were Punics. When Carthage fell in 146 BC to the Romans the coastal population was mainly Punic, but that influence decreased away from the coast. From the Roman period until the Islamic conquest, Latins, Greeks and Numidian people further influenced the Tunisians, which prior to the modern era, Tunisians were known as \"Afāriqah\", from the ancient name of Tunisia, Ifriqiya or Africa in the antiquity, which gave the present-day name of the continent Africa. From the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in 673, many Arabs settled with Arab tribes in Tunisia which was called Ifriqiya, in places like Kairouan which soon became one of the purely Arab settlements in the Umayyad Caliphate. This accelerated in the 11th century with the large migrations of the Arab tribes of Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym to Ifriqiya and the rest of the Maghreb. Some Persians and other Middle-Eastern populations also settled in Ifriqiya, which had its name from the ancient name, the Roman province of Africa. In the early-11th century, Normans from the Kingdom of Sicily took over Ifriqiya and founded the Kingdom of Africa, which lasted from 1135 to 1160. Muslim refugees from Sicily and Malta were encouraged by the Normans to settle in Tunisia during this period. After the Reconquista and expulsion of non-Christians and Moriscos from Spain, many Spanish Muslims and Jews also arrived. According to Matthew Carr, \"As many as eighty thousand Moriscos settled in Tunisia, most of them in and around the capital, Tunis, which still contains a quarter known as Zuqaq al-Andalus, or Andalusia Alley.\" Tunisians. During the 17th to the 19th centuries, Ifriqiya came under Spanish, then Ottoman rule and hosted Morisco then Italian immigrants from 1609. Tunis was officially integrated into the Ottoman Empire as the Eyalet of Tunis (province), eventually including all of the Maghreb except Morocco. Under the Ottoman Empire, the boundaries of the territory inhabited by Tunisians contracted; Ifriqiya lost territory to the west (Constantine) and to the east (Tripoli). In the 19th century, the rulers of Tunisia became aware of the ongoing efforts at political and social reform in the Ottoman capital. The Bey of Tunis then, by his own lights but informed by the Turkish example, attempted to effect a modernizing reform of institutions and the economy. Tunisian international debt grew unmanageable. This was the reason or pretext for French forces to establish a Protectorate in 1881. A remnant of the centuries of Turkish rule is the presence of a population of Turkish origin, historically the male descendants were referred to as the \"Kouloughlis\". Republic and Revolution. Independence from France was achieved on March 20, 1956. The State was established as a constitutional monarchy with the Bey of Tunis, Muhammad VIII al-Amin Bey, as the king of Tunisia. In 1957, the Prime Minister Habib Bourguiba abolished the monarchy and firmly established his Neo Destour (New Constitution) party. In the 1970s the economy of Tunisia expanded at a very healthy rate. Oil was discovered and tourism continued. City and countryside populations drew roughly equal in number. Yet agricultural problems and urban unemployment led to increased migration to Europe. The 84-year-old President Bourguiba was overthrown and replaced by Ben Ali his Prime Minister on November 7, 1987. However, the Ben Ali regime came to an end 23 years later on January 14, 2011, in the events of the Tunisian Revolution, following nationwide demonstrations precipitated by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions. Following the overthrow of Ben Ali, Tunisians elected a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution and an interim government known as the Troika because it was a coalition of three parties; the Islamist Ennahda Movement in the lead, with the centre-left Congress for the Republic and the left-leaning Ettakatol as minority partners. Widespread discontent remained however, leading to the 2013-2014 Tunisian political crisis. As a result of the efforts made by the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, the Constituent Assembly completed its work, the interim government resigned, and new elections were held in 2014, completing the transition to a democratic state. The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet was awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for \"its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Tunisian Revolution of 2011\". Beyond the political changes, which lead to Tunisia becoming a recognised democracy in 2014, those events also brought important changes to the post-2011 Tunisian culture. Population. Ethnic groups. The country\\'s population is predominantly composed of Arabs 98%. Other ethnic groups include 1% European who settled in the country and 1% of other ethnic groups, including mainly Berbers and sub-Saharan migrants. While Ottoman influence was particularly important in the formation of a Turkish-Tunisian community among the country\\'s elites, other peoples also migrated to Tunisia over different periods of time, including but not limited to, sub-Saharans, Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians (Punics), Jews and French settlers. Nevertheless, from 1870, the distinction between the Tunisian masses and the Turkish elite became blurred. There is also a minority Berber population (1%) mainly located in the Dahar mountains. From the late 19th century to after World War II, Tunisia was home to large populations of French and Italians (255,000 Europeans in 1956), although nearly all of them, along with the Jewish population, left after Tunisia became independent. The history of the Jews in Tunisia goes back some 2,600 years. In 1948 the Jewish population was an estimated 105,000, but by 2013 only about 900 remained. Culture. Tunisians are known for their hospitality, family values, and rich cultural heritage. Cultural symbols. Flag. The national flag of Tunisia is predominantly red and consists of a white circle in the middle containing a red crescent around a five-pointed star. The Hafsid dynasty used a similar flag during the Middle Ages, it consisted of a white crescent pointing upwards and a white five-pointed star but instead of featuring the red color it featured the yellow color. The crescent and star might also recall the Ottoman flag as an indication of Tunisia\\'s history as a part of the Ottoman Empire. Whitney Smith states that the crescent was first emblazoned on standards and buildings in the Punic state of Carthage, located in present-day Tunisia. Since appearing on the Ottoman flag, they were widely adopted by Muslim countries. The sun is often represented with the crescent on ancient Punic artifacts and is associated with the ancient Punic religion, especially with the Sign of Tanit. Coat of arms. As for the national coat of arms, they are officially adopted in 1861 and include revised versions on June 21, 1956, and May 30, 1963. The top has a Carthaginian galley sailing on the sea while the lower part is divided vertically and on the right depicts a black lion seizing a silver scimitar. A banner bears the national motto: \"Liberty, Order, Justice\". Jasmine. Imported by the Andalusians in the sixteenth century, jasmine has become the national flower of Tunisia. The gathering takes place at dawn and then, upon nightfall, when young boys collect small bouquets, and later sell them to passersby on the street or to motorists stopped at intersections. Furthermore, jasmine is the subject of a specific sign language. A man who wears jasmine on his left ear indicates that he is single and in addition, offering white jasmine is seen as a proof of love while on the contrary, offering odorless winter jasmine is a sign of insolence. Hamsa. The hamsa (, also romanized khamsa) is a palm-shaped amulet popular in Tunisia and more generally in the Maghreb, and commonly used in jewelry and wall hangings. Depicting the open right hand, an image recognized and used as a sign of protection in many times throughout history, the hamsa is believed to provide defense against the evil eye. It has been theorized that its origins lie in Carthage (modern-day Tunisia) and may have been associated with the Goddess Tanit. Chechia. The Chechia is the national headgear of Tunisia. Supple and cylindrical in shape, the chechia was imported into Tunisia in its current form from Spain, by the Moors expelled after the capture of Granada in 1492. Finding in Tunisia a second homeland, they establish the craft of the chechia there. After the independence of Tunisia in 1956 and with the arrival of manufactured goods and customs from the Europe, the wearing of the chechia tends to be limited to holidays and religious festivals; it is often associated with the elderly. Language. Tunisian Arabic is a set of dialects of Maghrebi Arabic spoken in Tunisia. In addition to mastering French. In the Tunisian diaspora makes it common for Tunisians to code-switch, mixing Arabic with French, English or other languages in daily speech. Moreover, Arabic Tunisian is closely related to the Maltese language, that descended from Maghrebi Arabic and Siculo-Arabic. Gastronomy. Tunisian cuisine is a blend of Mediterranean cuisine and traditions. Its distinctive spicy fieriness comes from neighbouring Mediterranean countries and the many civilizations who have ruled Tunisian land: Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Arabs, Spanish, Turkish, Italians (Sicilians), French, and the native Punics-Berber people. Tunisian food uses a variety of ingredients and in different ways. The main dish that is served in Tunisia is Couscous, made of minuscule grains that are cooked and usually served with meat and vegetables. In cooking they also use a variety of flavors such as: olive oil, aniseed, coriander, cumin, caraway, cinnamon, saffron, mint, orange, blossom, and rose water. Like all Mediterranean cultures, Tunisian culture offers a \"sun cuisine\", based mainly on olive oil, spices, tomatoes, seafood (a wide range of fish) and meat from rearing (lamb). Architecture. Tunisian architecture is traditionally expressed in various facets in Tunisia through Roman architecture and Islamic architecture. Through many buildings, Kairouan forms the epicenter of an architectural movement expressing the relationship between buildings and spirituality with the ornamental decoration of religious buildings in the holy city. In Djerba, the architecture such as the fortress of Kef reflects the military and spiritual destiny of a Sufi influence in the region. The influential role of the various dynasties that ruled the country, particularly in building cities and princes of Raqqada Mahdia, illuminates the role of the geopolitical context in the architectural history of the country. Thus, many original fortresses that protected the coast from Byzantine invasions evolved into cities, like Monastir, Sousse or Lamta. The medina of Tunis, is World Heritage Site of UNESCO, and is a typical example of Islamic architecture. However, in the areas between the ports of Bizerte and Ghar El Melh, settlements founded by the Moors fleeing Andalusia were reconquered by Catholic sovereigns and has more of a Christian influence. Given the cosmopolitan nature of cities in Tunisia, they have retained a diversity and juxtaposition of styles. Many buildings were designed by many different architects, artisans and entrepreneurs during the French protectorate. Among the most famous architects of that time were Victor Valensi, Guy Raphael, Henri Saladin, Joss Ellenon and Jean-Emile Resplandy. Five distinct architectural and decorative styles are particularly popular: those of the eclectic style (neo-classical, baroque, etc..) Between 1881 and 1900 and then again until 1920 the style was neo-Mauresque, between 1925 and 1940 it was in the Art Deco style and then the modernist style between 1943 and 1947. Music. According to Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Tunisian music has been influenced by old Andalusian songs injected with Turkish, Persian and Greek influences. Of major note in Tunisian classical music is the Malouf. Deriving from the reign of the Aghlabids in the 15th century, it is a particular type of Andalusian music. In urban areas it uses stringed instruments (fiddle, oud and Kanun) and percussion (darbuka) while in rural areas, it may also be accompanied by instruments like the mezoued, gasba and the zurna. The emergence of new patterns of racial and improvised music since the late 1990s changed the musical landscape of Tunisia. At the same time, the majority of the population is attracted by the music of Levantine origin (Egyptian, Lebanese or Syrian). Popular western music has also had major success with the emergence of many groups and festivals, including rock music, hip hop, reggae and jazz. Among the major Tunisian contemporary artists include Hedi Habbouba, Saber Rebaï, Dhafer Youssef, Belgacem Bouguenna, Sonia M\\'barek and Latifa. Other notable musicians include Salah El Mahdi, Anouar Brahem, Zied Gharsa and Lotfi Bouchnak. Cinema. Tunisian cinema is today recognized as one of the most liberal, most inventive (and one of the most prize-winning) cinemas of Africa and the Middle-east. Since the 90s, Tunisia became an attractive place for filming and numerous companies emerged, serving the foreign film industry and became successful. Tunisia also hosts the Carthage Film Festival which has been taking place since 1966. The festival gives priority to films from African and Middle-eastern countries. It is the oldest film festival on the African continent. Theatre. In over a century of existence, Tunisian theatre hosted or gave birth to big names, such as Sarah Bernhardt, Pauline Carton, Gérard Philipe and Jean Marais to mention a few. On November 7, 1962, Habib Bourguiba, whose brother is a playwright, devoted his speech to this art, which he considers \"a powerful means of disseminating culture and a most effective means of popular education\". From this date, November 7 is regarded as the Tunisian National Day of drama. Dance. The variety of dances performed by the Tunisians probably reflects the migration flows that have traversed the country throughout the centuries. Thus, the early Phoenicians brought with them their songs and dances, whose traces are rooted in the region of Tunis, while the Romans have left few traces of art in relation to their architectural contribution. Religious dances were influenced by Sufism but by the end of the 15th century, had progressively become Andalusian with their dances and urban music. Oriental dance would arrive later with the Ottomans, although some experts in the history of Northwest African art have said it was brought to Tunisia by the first Turkish corsairs in the sixteenth century while others say that the origin of this dance goes back further to the era of matriarchy in Mesopotamia and founded by the early Phoenicians. This form of oriental dance usually performed in Tunisia insists on the movements of the pelvis in rhythm, movement highlighted by the elevation of the arms to horizontal, and feet moving in rhythm and transferring weight onto the right leg or left. The Nuba, more rooted in popular practice, is linked to the dancers and the Kerkennah Djerba to a lesser extent. Some experts say that their dress is of Greek origin. Structured into several scenes, the dance is often accompanied by acrobatic games with jars filled with water. Literature. Among the Tunisian literary figures include Ali Douagi, who has produced more than 150 radio stories, over 500 poems and folk songs and nearly 15 plays, Khraief Bashir and others such as Moncef Ghachem, Mohamed Salah Ben Mrad or Mahmoud Messadi. As for poetry, Tunisian poetry typically opts for nonconformity and innovation with poets such as Aboul-Qacem Echebbi. As for literature, it is characterized by its critical approach. Contrary to the pessimism of Albert Memmi, who predicted that Tunisian literature was sentenced to die young, a high number of Tunisian writers are abroad including Abdelwahab Meddeb, Bakri Tahar, Mustapha Tlili, Hélé Béji or Mellah Fawzi. The themes of wandering, exile and heartbreak are the focus of their creative writing. The national bibliography lists 1249 non-school books published in 2002 in Tunisia. In 2006 this figure had increased to 1,500 and 1,700 in 2007. Nearly a third of the books are published for children. Tunisian Diaspora. Statistics of the Office of Tunisians Abroad show more than 128,000 Tunisian families in Europe with a concentration in France and Germany. Young Tunisians (less than 16 years of age) represent 25% of the Tunisian community abroad. Thus there is currently a rejuvenation of the Tunisian diaspora which is now in its third generation. Women represent nearly 26% of the total community. In France, their percentage is estimated at 38.2%. The portion of the diaspora who are over 60 years old is around 7%. Originally, the largest part of the Tunisians in Europe worked in sectors requiring minimal qualifications. In effect the migrants of the 1960s and 70s were less educated (mostly farmers or manual labourers). Subsequently, the majority of Tunisians settled in France have worked in the service sector (hotels, restaurants or retail) or have headed small businesses. In 2008, Tunisia became the first of the Maghreb countries to sign a management agreement concerning the flow of migrants, at the impetus of President Nicolas Sarkozy: it provides easy access for almost 9,000 Tunisian students enrolled in French institutions, but also almost 500 \"titres de séjour\" (residency permits) for highly qualified individuals so that they can acquire experience in France, valid for a maximum of six years.

Links with Tunisia. In Tunisia, free courses of instruction in Tunisian Arabic are organised during the summer holidays for the children of Tunisian residents abroad, who are heavily influenced by the culture of the countries in which they live. Trips are also organised for them to experience Tunisian culture, history and civilisation. Genetic. Tunisians mainly carry E1b1 haplogroup (55%) and J1 haplogroup (34.2%). Listed here are the human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups in Tunisia. Elkamel, Sarra et al. (2021) wrote that: \"Considering Tunisian populations as a whole, the majority part of their paternal haplogroups are of autochthonous Berber origin (71.67%), which co-exists with others assumedly from the Middle East (18.35%) and to a lesser extent from Sub-Saharan Africa (5.2%), Europe (3.45%) and Asia (1.33%).\"',\n",
       " 'The first president of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and most of his family were killed during the early hours of 15 August 1975 by a group of young Bangladesh Army personnel who invaded his Dhanmondi 32 residence as part of a coup d\\'état. Minister of Commerce Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad immediately took control of the government and proclaimed himself president. The assassination marked the first direct military intervention in Bangladesh\\'s civilian administration-centric politics. 15 August is National Mourning Day, an official national holiday in Bangladesh. Background. Mujib\\'s presidency. In the 1970 Pakistani general election, Sheikh Mujib\\'s party, the Awami League (previously known as the Awami Muslim League), won the majority of the seats in the Pakistani National Assembly. They won 167 of the 169 seats in East Pakistan, which would later become Bangladesh after it seceded from West Pakistan. Despite Pakistan\\'s military government delaying the handover of power, Mujib\\'s house had become the de facto head of government in East Pakistan by March. At the start of the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, he was arrested in his home by Pakistani soldiers on 25 March midnight just after declaring the independence of Bangladesh. Later that year, the provisional government of the Bangladeshi rebellion, the Mujibnagar Government, formed on 10 April and made Mujib its head and also the leader of Bangladeshi armed forces. Following the defeat of Pakistani forces on 16 December 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from custody from Pakistan in London on 22 December 1971 and flew to India followed by Bangladesh. Mujib led the government as Prime Minister of Bangladesh for three years after Bangladesh gained independence. Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini controversy and outrage in the army. The Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini (JRB) was a controversial militia formed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and loyal to him personally. Although it was originally founded as a law enforcing agency to maintain internal security, it became a second national armed-force and served as a political task force for the Awami League. As a result, it found little support among traditional military organisations such as the Mukti Bahini. Its 30,000 troops intimidated and tortured opponents of the Awami League in various ways. The military grew resentful of the level of funding the Rakshi Bahini received from the Mujib government, with the former\\'s own funding being reduced to 13% in the 1975-1976 budget, a considerable decrease from the 50–60% it enjoyed during the Pakistan period. This dissatisfaction is also considered one of the reasons for Mujibur\\'s assassination. Allegation of nepotism and corruption within the Mujib-family. Sheikh Fazlul Haque Mani was given lucrative positions in the Government formed by Sheikh Mujibur. When private trade with India was banned due to slow inflation, Fazlul Haque actively engaged in it with Mujibur\\'s blessings. This was seen as an attempt by Mujibur to form a dynasty. Near the end of 1973, Sheikh Kamal was involved in a shootout in which he suffered gunshot injuries. Multiple claims have been made as to how the shootout occurred. Many people claim that it was during an attempted robbery of a bank by Sheikh Kamal and his friends. However, a retired major general of the Bangladesh Army claimed that it was actually a case of friendly fire. Near the end of 1973, Bangladeshi security forces received intelligence that the left-wing revolutionary activist Siraj Sikder and his insurgents were going to launch coordinated attacks around Dhaka. Police and other security officers were on full alert and patrolling the streets of Dhaka in plainclothes. Sheikh Kamal and his friends were armed and also patrolling the city in a microbus looking for Siraj Sikder. When the microbus was in Dhanmondi, the police mistook Sheikh Kamal and his friends for insurgents and opened fire on them, thus injuring Sheikh Kamal. However, it is also claimed that Sheikh Kamal and his friends were in Dhanmondi to test drive a new car that his friend Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku had bought recently. Since Dhaka was under heavy police patrolling, police special forces under the command of the then city SP Mahamuddin Bir Bikrom opened fire on the car thinking that the passengers were miscreants. A 1976 issue of the Asia Yearbook stated, \"It was an open secret - that Mujib\\'s brother, Sheikh Nazir, was alleged to have monopolised the smuggling in the southeast; that his wife took a cut in contracting World Bank projects; that his son, Sheikh Kamal, had been involved in thuggery; and that his nephew, Sheikh Moni, was fast accumulating power and wealth. Abdul Waheed Talukder, in his book \"Gonotontrer Onneshay Bangladesh\" (গণতন্ত্রের অন্বেষায় বাংলাদেশ, Bangladesh in Search of Democracy), said in the 1976 issue of the Asia Yearbook, Marcus F. Franda in his book \"Bangladesh: The First Decade\" says, S. R. Mirza says in his book \"Conversations after the War of Liberation\", Left-wing insurgency. A left-wing insurgency from 1972 to 1975 is widely held to be responsible for creating the conditions that led to the assassination. In 1972, a leftist group named the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) was founded from a split in the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the Bangladesh Awami League. The JSD, through its armed wing Gonobahini led by Colonel Abu Taher and politician Hasanul Haq Inu, began a political massacre of government supporters, Awami League members, and police. Their campaign contributed to a breakdown of law and order in the country and paved the way for the assassination of Mujib. Hasanul Huq Inu later held the office of the Minister of Information under Sheikh Hasina\\'s Second and Third cabinets. Dalim-Mostafa conflict. In 1974, Gazi Golam Mostafa kidnapped Major Shariful Haque Dalim and his wife from the Dhaka Ladies Club after an argument during Dalim\\'s cousin\\'s wedding reception. Dalim\\'s only brother-in-law Bappi (his wife Nimmi\\'s brother) was attending from Canada. Mostafa\\'s son occupied the chair in the row behind Bappi and pulled Bappi\\'s hair from the back. Bappi scolded the boy for his behavior and told him not to sit on the row behind him anymore. Mostafa\\'s sons (who were close friends of Sheikh Kamal) and some associates forcefully abducted Dalim, Nimmi, the groom\\'s mother, and two of Dalim\\'s friends (both of whom were distinguished freedom fighters) in Microbuses owned by the Red Crescent. Mostafa was taking them to the Rakhi Bahini headquarters but later took them to the residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Mujib mediated a compromise between them and made Mostafa apologize to Nimmi. When news of the abduction spread, the 1st Bengal Lancers ransacked Mostafa\\'s and took his whole family prisoner. They also set up check posts all over the city searching for Major Dalim and the abductees. Some officers lost their jobs as a result. The officers involved, including Shariful Haque Dalim, were later orchestrators of the coup on 15 August 1975 and the assassination of Sheikh Mujib. Rise and death of Siraj Sikder. Siraj Sikder was contemporary leading Bangladeshi Maoist leader, in Mujib\\'s regime. Born in 1944, he obtained an engineering degree from the East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology (now BUET) in 1967. While he was a student he became a member of East Pakistan Student Union. In 1967, he was elected vice-president of the central committee of Student Union and later that year he joined the C & B Department of the government as an engineer. Later he left his job to start a private engineering company. On 8 January 1968, along with like-minded activists, Sikder formed a clandestine organisation named Purba Bangla Sramik Andolon (East Bengal Workers Movement EBWM) with an objective to lead a struggle against the revisionism of the existing \"Communist\" organisations and to form a revolutionary Communist Party. This initiative brought forward a thesis that East Bengal is a colony of Pakistan and that the principal contradiction in the society is between the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and feudalists of Pakistan on one hand, and the people of East Bengal on the other hand. Only the independence struggle to form an \"independent, democratic, peaceful, non-aligned, progressive\" People\\'s Republic of East Bengal, free also from the oppression of US imperialism, Soviet social-imperialism and Indian Expansionism could lead the society forward towards socialism and communism. In late 1968, Sikder left the job to establish the Mao Tse Tung Research Center in Dhaka but it was later closed down by the Pakistani government. Sikder became a lecturer at the Technical Training College in Dhaka. In the meantime of Bangladesh War of Independence, at a liberated base area named Pearabagan at Bhimruly in Jhalokati District in the southern part of the country, on 3 June 1971, Sikder founded a new party named Purba Banglar Sarbahara Party (Proletarian Party of East Bengal) by ideology of Marxism and Mao Tsetung Thought (not \"Maoism\", during the 1960s the followers of Mao-line used to identify their ideology as Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse-tung Thought). At the beginning of the war, he went to Barisal and he declared that as a free living space and making it his base attempted to initiate his revolution throughout other places. After the Independence of Bangladesh he turned against the Sheikh Mujib government. In April 1973, he formed Purba Banglar Jatiya Mukti Front (East Bengal National Liberation Front) and declared war on Bangladesh Government. Under his leadership, the Sarbahara party carried out attacks against money lenders and landlords. In 1975, Sikder was arrested at Hali Shahar in Chittagong by the intelligence force of the government. He was killed in police custody on 3 January 1975 on his way from Dhaka Airport to the Rakkhi Bahini Camp at Savar. Anthony Mascarenhas narrated in his book \"\" that, Siraj\\'s sister Shamim Sikder blamed Mujib for the killing of her brother. Famine of 1974. Ever since independence, the possibility of famine started appearing in Bangladesh. Corrupt administration, worsening flood situation, failure to deal with food crisis led to famine in North Bengal in 1974. The death toll from the famine is claimed to be between 27,000 and 15 lakh or approximately 300,000 to 4,500,000 (or 1 to 1.5 million). Mahfuz Ullah wrote in bis book \"Press under Mujib regime\" that, According to many analysts, the famine reduced the popularity of the Mujib government and contributed to the circumstances of his assassination. Corruption, malfunction and BAKSAL. Sheikh Mujib later made himself President of Bangladesh and established a national unity government, the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL), on 7 June 1975 by banning all political parties and independent press. Mujib named the reform as Second Revolution. Although the BAKSAL was intended to bring stability to Bangladesh and uphold law and order, it engendered hostility among the bureaucracy, military, and civil society. Opposition groups, as well as some of Mujib\\'s supporters, challenged Mujib\\'s authoritarian, one-party state. The period of the BAKSAL\\'s one-party rule was marked by widespread censorship and abuse of the judiciary, as well as opposition from the general populace, intellectuals, and all other political groups. Nationalization of industry failed to yield any tangible progress. Not only was the government weak and with no clear goals, but the country was also nearly bankrupt. In the \"Far Eastern Economic Review\", journalist Lawrence Lifschultz wrote in 1974 that \"the corruption and malpractices and plunder of national wealth\" in Bangladesh were \"unprecedented\". Party-partiality against rape-murder case. The army was already dissatisfied with Sheikh Mujib for sidelining them in favor of the JRB. However, in his book , Anthony Mascarenhas cited a specific factor behind the final outcry as influential: Mozammel, a contemporary Awami League youth leader from Tongi and the chairman of Tongi Awami League, seized a car of a newlywed housewife, killed her driver and husband, abducted her and gang-raped her and three days later, her dead body was found in the road near a bridge of Tongi. Mozammel was arrested by a leader of a squadron of the Bengal Lancer named Major Nasser and handed over to the police, but the police released him immediately. At that time, many people thought that he was released from the punishment of that crime only with the intervention of Sheikh Mujib. This incident increased the dissatisfaction against Sheikh Mujib in the Army, specially in Major Faruque and acted as one of the prominently last-minute influences behind his assassination. Conspirators. Major Syed Faruque Rahman; Khandaker Abdur Rashid; Shariful Haque Dalim; Mohiuddin Ahmed; and Rashed Chowdhury, along with A.K.M. Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, and S.H.M.B Noor Chowdhury (three majors in the Bangladesh Army and veterans of the Bangladesh Liberation War), planned to topple the government and establish a military government of their own. They were previously part of the opposition to BAKSAL and viewed the government as too subservient to India and as a threat to Bangladesh\\'s military. According to Anthony Mascarenhas, Faruque offered Major Ziaur Rahman indirectly to take part in the plan and tried to convince him, but Zia cleverly avoided the matter. According to Farooq, Zia\\'s gesture meant: \"I\\'m a senior officer. I cannot be involved in such things. If you junior officers want to do it, go ahead.\" However, the killer Lt. Col. Khandaker Abdur Rashid\\'s wife and accused Jobaida Rashid said in his deposition, \"Criticism was happened among Army officers for providing more facilities by forming Rakkhi Bahini besides the army. I hear these things from Farooq. Major Farooq has been in touch with General Zia since childhood. He was Zia\\'s former acquaintance. One night Major Farooq returned from Zia\\'s house and told my husband that Zia wanted to be president if the government changed. Zia said, \"\"It is a success to come to me. If it is a failure then do not involve me. It is not possible to change the government by keeping Sheikh Mujib alive\".\" Major General (retd) M Khalilur Rahman (then director of BDR) testified, \"Some army officers became divided as General Safiullah was not made the army chief despite being a senior on the basis of General Zia\\'s number. I have heard that General Zia will retire from the army and be sent abroad as an ambassador.\" At one point after the swearing in of the cabinet, Major Rashid introduced me to his wife. I thought Major Rashid was a little proud and said, \"She is my wife. My wife is the mastermind behind what we have done.\" The assassins considered the possible causes of the failure, and for the upcoming after-period after Mujib\\'s assassination, they decided to use a well-wisher from Mujib\\'s Awami League and a person who could be removed in time if desired, in order to curb the possible Indian intervention, the Awami League\\'s vengeful armed opposition, the possible increasing arbitrariness of the anti-Awami League and to temporarily control the situation. After some time of searching, an Awami League cabinet minister under Mujib\\'s government, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, agreed to take over the presidency. Journalist Lawrence Lifschultz paints an alternate picture of the conspiracy, however, that implicates Mostaq and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He claimed that the \"CIA station chief in Dhaka, Philip Cherry, was actively involved in the killing of the Father of the Nation—Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\" His claims largely relied on the testimony of a single anonymous businessman, however. It is alleged that the Chief of Army Staff, Major General Kazi Mohammed Shafiullah, and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence Air Vice Marshal, Aminul Islam Khan, were aware of the conspiracy. Major Faruque told Anthony Mascarenhas that he carried out the assassination following the direction of Andha Hafiz, a blind saint from Chittagong who was known having supernatural powers and his wife Farida helped him communicate with the saint. The saint entitled as a pir told him to carry out the killing in the interest of Islam, advised him to abandon personal interests and carry out the killing at the right time. However, Andha Hafiz later denied the claim in an interview with the weekly Bichinta. Assassination. In the early hours of Friday, 15 August 1975, the conspirators divided into four groups. One group, consisting of members of the Bengal Lancers of the First Armoured Division and 535th Infantry Division under Major Huda, attacked Mujib\\'s residence. A correspondent for \"Anandabazar Patrika\", Sukharanjan Dasgupta, who described the Bangladesh Liberation War in Dhaka until 1974, writes in his book \"Midnight Massacre in Dacca\" that \"the exact details of the massacre will always remain shrouded in mystery\". He went on to say that the army platoon protecting the president\\'s house offered no resistance. Sheikh Kamal, son of Mujib, was shot at the reception area on the ground floor. Meanwhile, Mujib was asked to resign and allowed time to consider his choice. He telephoned Colonel Jamil Uddin Ahmad, the new Chief of Military Intelligence. When Jamil arrived and ordered the troops back to the barracks, he was gunned down at the gate of the residence. After he refused to resign, Mujib was shot and killed. Other people killed in the attack were Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib, wife of Mujib, who was killed upstairs; Sheikh Nasser, younger brother of Mujib, who was killed in a lavatory; several servants of Mujib, who were also killed in lavatories; Sheikh Jamal, the second son of Mujib and an army officer; ten-year-old Sheikh Russel, the youngest son of Mujib; and two daughters-in-law of Mujib. In Dhanmondi, two other groups of soldiers killed Sheikh Fazlul Haque Mani, Mujib\\'s nephew and a leader of the Awami League along with his pregnant wife, Arzu Moni, and Abdur Rab Serniabat, Mujib\\'s brother-in-law. They also killed a minister of the government and thirteen of his family members on Mintu Road. The fourth and most powerful group was sent towards Savar to repel the expected counter-attack by the security forces stationed there. After a brief fight and the loss of eleven men, the security forces surrendered. A 24-hour curfew was imposed on the day of the assassination. However, for Friday prayers at 12:30 p.m. an adjournment was given till 2 o\\'clock. The next day there was a break in the 24-hour curfew from 9:30 to 12:00. On 17 August there was an adjourned from 6 am to evening. A break was given on August 18 from morning to 10 in the night. Schools, colleges, offices, courts and factories were fully opened from that day. Four of the founding leaders of the Awami League, first Prime Minister of Bangladesh Tajuddin Ahmed, former Prime Minister Mansur Ali, former Vice President Syed Nazrul Islam, and former Home Minister A.\\xa0H.\\xa0M. Qamaruzzaman, were arrested. Three months later, on 3 November 1975, they were murdered in Dhaka Central Jail. Aftermath. On the morning of the assassination, the then Lieutenant Colonel Amin Ahmed Chowdhury entered the house of General Ziaur Rahman and found out on the radio that President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had been assassinated. He described the incident: \"General Zia is shaving on one side but not on the other. Came running in the sleeping suit, he asked Shafaat Jamil, \"What happened, Shafaat?\" Shafaat replied, \"Apparently two battalions staged a coup. We don\\'t know yet what happened outside. We hear the announcement on the radio that the president is dead.\" Then General Zia said, \"So what? Let vice-president take over. We have nothing to do with politics. Get your troops ready. Uphold the constitution.\" Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad assumed the presidency, and Major General Ziaur Rahman became the new Chief of Army Staff. The leading conspirators were all given high government ranks. They were all later toppled by yet another coup led by Brigadier General Khaled Mosharraf on 3 November 1975. Mosharraf himself was killed during a counter-revolt four days later on 7 November, which freed Major General Ziaur Rahman in power and was brought in to bring law and order. Major Syed Faruque Rahman, Rashid, and the other army officers were promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Nevertheless, they were exiled to Libya, China, Rhodesia, Canada, and other countries, although they were given several diplomatic posts in Bangladeshi missions abroad. Lieutenant Colonel (Rtd.) Syed Faruque Rahman later returned and founded the Bangladesh Freedom Party in 1985 and took part in the presidential election in 1987 against the military ruler Lieutenant General Hussain Mohammad Ershad but lost that election in a landslide. Mujib\\'s two daughters, Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, were in West Germany at the time of his assassination. After the coup, they were barred from returning to Bangladesh and were granted asylum by India. Sheikh Hasina lived in New Delhi in exile before returning to Bangladesh on 17 May 1981. Protest. After the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, its first protest took place in Barguna. Freedom fighter Motaleb Mridha Barguna SDO Siraj Uddin Ahmed led BLA president Jahangir Kabir led by 10-15 BLA workers took out a procession. Later, leaders and workers of Awami League, Jubo League and Chhatra League of Barguna joined in the protest march. On the morning of August 15, protests were held in various places including Kishoreganj, Bhairab, Khulna, Jessore, Faridganj in Chandpur, Mohanganj in Netrakona, Gafargaon in Mymensingh. Later, Abdul Quader Siddiqui divided 17,000 Mujib fans into 7 fronts and waged a resistance war for 22 months. 104 fighters were killed and hundreds were injured. Among them, the rebellion and struggle of 500 youths of Sherpur Sadar, Srivardi, Jhenaigati and Nakla upazilas of \\'500 protesters of Sherpur\\' was discussed. Mufti Nurullah protested this in his Friday prayer sermon the next day. In August, Chittagong City College students protested. Freedom fighter commander Maulvi Syed, student leader ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and later Awami League leader S.M. Yusuf began to resist. On October 18th, the Chhatra League and Student Union protested by writing posters and writing on the walls of Dhaka University. A protest rally was held on October 20. On August 18, 1976, 5 freedom fighters Javed Ali, Nikhil Dutt, Subodh Dhar, Dipal Das, Mofiz Uddin were killed in an army operation. The surviving youth fighter, named Biswajit Nandi was arrested, and sentenced to be executed by hanging after being found guilty by a military court on May 18, 1977. Influenced by influential world leaders including Indira Gandhi, Biswajit received a commutation of his death sentence to life imprisonment. He was released in 1989. Tributes. The assassination changed the course of politics in Bangladesh, and the ramifications of which are still being felt across South Asia. Many world leaders, eminent personalities, at that time, expressed their shock and condemned the heinous act of killing. Fidel Castro, leader and the president of Cuba, said,Indira Gandhi, the prime minister of India, said,Willy Brandt, nobel laureate and former chancellor of Germany, said, Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq, said,Henry Kissinger, American diplomat and politician, said, Mark Tully, the bureau chief of BBC, said,Fenner Brockway, member of the UK HOUSE OF LORDS, said, Yasser Arafat, the president of Palestine, said,Kenneth Kaunda, the president of Zambia, said, The All India Radio broadcast said, Trial and executions. The military decided not to court-martial the military officers who masterminded and participated in the coup. A.\\xa0F.\\xa0M. Mohitul Islam, personal assistant to Sheikh Mujib and a survivor of the attack on his house, attempted to file a case against the military officers, but the police slapped him in the face and refused to file the report. The assassination conspirators could not be tried in a court of law because of the Indemnity Act passed by the government under President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. When the Awami League, led by Mujib\\'s daughter, Sheikh Hasina, won elections in 1996, the act was repealed. The Bangabandhu murder trial began with the case filing by A.\\xa0F.\\xa0M. Mohitul Islam. Colonel (Rtd.) Syed Faruque Rahman was arrested from his Dhaka home, and Colonel (Rtd.) Bazlul Huda was brought back from Bangkok, where he was serving a prison sentence for shoplifting as part of a criminal exchange program between Thailand and Bangladesh. Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed was in active military service when he was arrested. Colonel (Rtd.) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan had been appointed to active diplomatic service by previous Prime Minister of Bangladesh Begum Khaleda Zia, but he returned to Bangladesh and was arrested when he was recalled by the foreign ministry. Colonel (Rtd.) Abdur Rashid and other accused individuals had already left Bangladesh, however. They believed that the upcoming 1996 general election would be an Awami League victory, which would result in the repealing of the Indemnity Act and their subsequent arrest. Colonel (Rtd.) Rashid now reportedly shuttles between Pakistan and Libya. All these men were also involved in Jail Killing on 3 November 1975, when four Awami League officials were assassinated. The first trial ended on 8 November 1998. The District and Session Judge of Dhaka, Mohammad Golam Rasul, ordered the death sentence by firing squad to fifteen out of the twenty accused of conspiring in the assassination. The sentences were not carried out immediately, because five of the convicts sought to file appeals in the high court division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. The Supreme Court, consisting of Justice Mohammad Ruhul Amin and Justice A.\\xa0B.\\xa0M. Khairul Haque, who was the former Chief Justice of Bangladesh, gave a divisive verdict. Senior Justice Amin acquitted five out of the original fifteen accused, whereas Junior Justice Haque upheld the lower court\\'s verdict. A verdict from a third judge became necessary. Later, Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim condemned twelve out of original fifteen, including two acquitted in Justice Amin\\'s verdict. One of the convicts, Major (Rtd.) Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe on 2 June 2001. Although the five accused appealed to the appellate division of the Supreme Court, their decision remained pending from August 2001. Several judges refused to hear the case, which meant the government lacked the three judges required to hold a hearing session. On 18 June 2007, one of the conspirators who had been sentenced to death, Major (Rtd.) A.K.M. Mohiuddin Ahmed was extradited to Bangladesh from the United States following a series of failed attempts to gain asylum or permanent residency in the United States. On 7 August 2007, the murder case hearings resumed after a six-year delay. The appellate division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh gave its verdict on 19 November 2009, after a five-member special bench, headed by Justice Mahammad Tafazzal Islam, spent 29 days hearing the petition filed by the convicted. The appeal of the convicts was rejected, and the death sentence was upheld. Before the verdict, approximately 12,000 extra policemen were deployed to guard strategic buildings, including the Supreme Court building, to prevent disruption of the proceedings by the convicted men\\'s supporters. Nevertheless, they were blamed by the government for a grenade attack on one of the prosecution lawyers in October 2009, although no one has been charged yet. Captain (Rtd.) Qismet Hashem, Captain (Rtd.) Nazmul Hossain Ansar, and Major (Rtd.) Abdul Majid were acquitted through the high court division and appellate division verdicts and now lives in Canada. Taheruddin Thakur, former Information Minister and one of the suspects, was cleared during the Hasina Government, acquitted in trial, and released. He died of natural causes in 2009. Conspirators Major (Rtd.) Bazlul Huda, Lieutenant Colonel (Rtd.) Mohiuddin Ahmed, Major (Rtd.) A.K.M. Mohiuddin Ahmed, Colonel (Rtd.) Syed Faruque Rahman, and Colonel (Rtd.) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan were executed by hanging on 28 January 2010. On 11 April 2020, Abdul Majed was executed by hanging. He had returned to Bangladesh the previous month after being a fugitive for 23 years. Literary interpretation of the assassination. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated on 15 August 1975 at the dawn on Friday along with all other family members staying at the Dhanmondi 32 on that fateful night. This man is considered as the Father of the nation and keeps behind a legacy that spiritualizes that great man even after his fateful demise..This article describes the literary texts regarding the impact of the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The literary texts are categorized into three sections: the literatures which explain the background of the assassination; the literatures which describe the assassination incidences detailed or implied; and the political polarization after the incidences. Background in the literature. The literature, especially the historical literature, ranging from the year of the incident to the recent work explains the causes behind the assassination. There are few literatures that highlight the cause of the military coup, the resentment of the army etc. as the book: \"Empires at war: a short history of modern Asia since World War II,\" \"A Political and Economic Dictionary of South Asia,\" and \"Cascades of Violence: War, Crime and Peacebuilding Across South Asia\" \\xa0are few of the many. Again; a sect of literatures highlight the rise of some para militia, Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini, and militant groups, Purba Banglar Sarbahara Party. is the book which knits the web of these factional elements and their operations in the decade of 70\\'s. The economic meltdown, the flood in 1974 and the famine due to these critical transitions are also exposed in the \"Democracy and Famine\". Military resentment. The 15 August 1975 Mujib assassination marks the first direct military intervention in the then administration- centric Bangladesh politics. There are references on the condensation of the political misunderstanding among the \"Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini\" founded in 1972 by the patronization of Mujib, Mukti Bahini founded during the war time, and the military. It is reported that the military would receive 50-60% funding during the Pakistani period that the Muijb government reduced it to 13% that raised a tacit resentment among the military. Rise of factional groups. The Liberation war ended. The occupied forces surrendered and left the country. Bangladesh then had to face a second-level of factionalism among the people in the country that literature portrays. \"The Good Muslim\" by Tahmima Anam presents the ravages of war, the confrontation with religious fundamentalism and the socio-political disharmony interplaying in the war torn country. The cover page of the book reads:Set in Bangladesh at a time when Islamic fundamentalism is on the rise, \"The Good Muslim\" is an epic story about faith, family and the long shadow of war. Tahmima Anam, the prize-winning author of A Golden Age, offers a moving portrait of a sister and brother who struggle with the competing loyalties of love and belief as they cope with the lasting ravages of war and confront the deeply intimate roots of religious extremism. Echoing the intensity and humanity of Thrity Umrigar\\'s The Space Between Us, Abraham Verghese\\'s Cutting for Stone, and Kiran Desai\\'s The Inheritance of Loss, Anam\\'s \"accomplished and gripping novel\", in the words of author Pankaj Mishra, \"describes not only the tumult of a great historical event, but also the small but heroic struggles of individuals living in the shadow of revolution and war\".The period 1971-1975 experienced the changes of role among the veterans due to their new orientation on the socio-economic-political scenarios. Siraj Sikdar was one of them who was one of the front line freedom fighters; yet he had to change his political aesthetics around 1973 and indulged in militancy by the name of \"Proletarian Party\". Antony Mascarenhas has commented in the \"\" (1986) that Shamim Shikder, sister of Siraj Sikder, blames the government for the death of him in the police custody on 3 January 1975. Economic meltdown. Olivier Rubin in his book \"\"Democracy and Famine\"\" has remarked that one-party state is a reality if the famine engulfs the fragile democratic society. He pointed out the 1974 famine in Bangladesh as a case study. As a new independent country, Bangladesh had to experience economic crisis. The flood in July and August, 1974 triggered the crisis exponentially. Thus, food scarcity, improper distribution of leftover food reported to have 1 to 1.5 million of death in Bangladesh. This led the then Mujib government in question. And these critical atmospheres led to the assassination of the Father of the nation according to the case study of Olivier Rubin. Incidents reflected in the literature. Apart from the news of electronic and print media; the novels, poetry, and performing arts draw the harrowing pictures of the assassination. Novels. Deyal (Walls) is a novel by Humayun Ahmed that narrates the assassination of the father of the nation. This is the only novel that takes the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the background, though the novel raised some contradictions on the factual inconsistencies in some cases, and eventually the court declared ruling against the publication of the book without correction. Critics say that Colonel Farooq, the killer of Bangabandhu, has been shown in this novel as a little great. However, Dr. Syed Manzoorul Islam has a distinct opinion that Humayun Ahmed had allowed him to read the draft copy of the wall. The opinion tells, Deyal may be contradictory on the political ground; but it brings the legacy of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman that implicates the killing was a remarkable moment in the History of Bangladesh. Literary reflection of the aftermath. Poetry. The first literary piece on the remembrance of Bangabandhu at his assassination was an elegy. It is reported and well documented that Moulovi Sheikh Abdul Hamid, the close friend of Bangabandhu, at Tungipara \\xa0was the first composer of the elegy in the memory of the death of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He was the man who laid down the assassinated man in the grave and conducted all the funeral rites. He wrote in emotion:O great one—whose flesh, blood and bones are interred in this grave Whose light lit up all of Hindustan, and especially Bangladesh I am dedicating myself to your grave, to you who is lying in this grave.Poetry exceeded in numbers in comparison to other literary media to highlight the aftereffect of the assassination on 15 August 1975 and afterwards linked to the assassination of the founder of the nation. Nirmalendu Goon, Syed Shamsul Haque, Shamsur Rahman, Mahadev Saha were remarkable poets whose pen raised concern for the death of the father of the nation. Nirmalendu Goon was outspoken in his poems to celebrate the legacy of Bangabandhu. He has three great poems on Bangabandhu that goes- A Tale of That Night draws the crimson picture of the fateful night of the vile assassination. The stanza of the poem goes;Your legs didn\\'t stagger even for once Nor did your eyes twitch; To stop wastage of bullets of the coup de tat You thrust forth your chest, for you know, Every bullet costs more than a farmer\\'s meal. (\"A Tale of That Night\") The poet, \"Nurul Huda,\" directly hinted to the loss of the country that Bangadesh had on the 15th August, 1975. His poem \"Fifteen August\" speaks; Today it\\'s empty and blazing all around, Today all feel shattered to the core in grief, All over Radha, Vanga, Harikela, Samatata , Let heavy rains pour on the Bangalees\\' thunderstruck chest (p.\\xa07) The poets of the West Bengal were likely moved by this incidents and they had to write elegiac notes, and eulogy for Bangabandhu. The name of the Poet, Annada Shankar Roy comes first. The poet and essayist writes in his poem, \"Bangabandhu\" thatAs long as the rivers Padma, Jamuna, Gauri, Meghna run, So long will survive your glory Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. (Bangabandhu) Shamsur Rahman had political and historical conscience and he could duly reflect them in his poetry. The being of Bangladesh and its struggle against tyranny is visible in the lines. Bangabandhu covered a great spaces in his writings related to the liberation war, political upheavals and even the assassination taken place in 1975. The poems referred highlight the loss, repentance, agony, and anger for the perpetrators who grasped the statue of freedom to vandalize it: \\xa0 \"\"Bangladesh Swapna Dekhe\", (Bangladesh dreams)\" \"\"Dhaynya Sei Purush\", (The Successful Man)\" \"\"Nam\", (Name)\" \"\"Bhaskar Purush\", (An Enlightened Man)\" \"\"Tomar Nam Ek Biplab\", (Revolution is Thy Name)\" \"\\'Sonar Murtir Kahini, (A History of Golden Statue)\" The writer did not stop here only with the drops of tears. He dreamed of the revenge for this. Here \"\"The Song of Electra\" (Electrar Gaan)\" in the poetry \"\"The Sky of Ikarus\" (Ikraser Akash) (1982)\" reveals the motif of vengeance with the allusion of the mythical story of Electra who had intension to avenge for the killing of her father \"Agamemnon\". She reveals \"My heat burns as a Red Hibiscus with the fire of Vengeance\" (64). \\xa0 Movies. After the carnage happened on 15 August 1975; several coups de tat took place and 3 November 1975 killing of the four national leaders in the custody was second in importance. Yet, few grand literatures are written in these clamorous times of Bangladeshi history. However, August 1975, a film directed by Shamim Ahamed Roni and produced by Selim Khan is a memorable contribution in the case of performing art. This movie portrays the dusky situations prevailing after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.Thus, the film is an addition to the realm of literary history that could make the after-assassination visualize through the literary pieces Songs. A song that creates an eternal appeal is \"Jodi Raat Pohale Shona Jeto\" (If the dawn spread the resurrection). If the dawn spread the resurrection Of Bangabandhu, If the highways became crowdy with procession That \\'We want His freedom\\'; The world could have a great leader The Bangalee could get their father. \\xa0 The man never bowed down like a coward, Before the tyrants and miscreants, He rather snatched back our freedom From the clutches of heinous occupants. No one is so great a Bangalee That the history repeats someday, You can never cover up the truth That will peep out of the fake. is the song writer; Moloy Kumar Ganguly is the music composer and the singer for this song. In 1990, Matiur Rahman wrote this song and Moloy Kumar, the singer for the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra composed the music. He expressed that it took 15 minutes for him to make it as a song. This song first recorded in the production company of Hasan Matiur Rahman in 1991 for the election campaign of Bangladesh Awami League. This song is made to sing by Sabina Yasmin in 1997 and Farid Ahmed arranged the music for this remake.',\n",
       " 'Ceriana (locally , Genoese: ) is a \"comune\" (municipality) in the Province of Imperia in the Italian region Liguria, located about southwest of Genoa and about west of Imperia. As of 2018, it had a population of 1,214 and an area of . Ceriana borders the following municipalities: Badalucco, Bajardo, Sanremo, and Taggia. History. Built on the site of a Roman fort, Castrum Colianum (from whence the name Ceriana derives), the city took its present shape mostly in the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. Gian Battista Embriaco (1829–1903), professor at the Roman College of Saint Thomas and the inventor in 1867 of the hydrochronometer, was born in Ceriana. Examples of his hydrochronometer can be found in Rome on the gardens of the Pincian Hill and in the Villa Borghese gardens. Embriaco had presented two prototypes of his invention at the Paris Universal Exposition in 1867 where it won prizes and great acclaim. Culture. Celebrities. Giulio Natta, nobel prize for chemistry in 1963, lived in Ceriana, on via della visitazione. Today, there is a plaque in his memory next to his house. Festivals. Despite its small population, Ceriana hosts celebrations and events on its main square on most weekends throughout the year, drawing tourists from nearby Sanremo, Nice and beyond. Annual festivals include: Music. \"La Banda Musicale di Ceriana\" (The Music Band of Ceriana) was originally formed in 1882. Its current iteration was reformed in 1950. Easter Procession.

       " 'Alejandra and Aeron, also known as Bergman and Salinas, are Alejandra Salinas (Spanish: born 1977 in La Rioja) and Aeron Bergman (American: born 1971 in Detroit), artists living in Detroit, Michigan. They are an artist duo producing media, performance, internet, sound and sculptural works and objects in an interdisciplinary, conceptual yet socially engaged practice. Biography. Bergman and Salinas\\' work has been exhibited internationally including at the 4th Athens Biennale; the Bergen Assembly Triennial; Steirischer Herbst in Graz; Eastside Projects in Birmingham, UK; Serralves Museum in Porto; ICC Tokyo; DAC in New York; Taipei Fine Art Museum; Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, The Netherlands; Centre Georges-Pompidou and Palais de Tokyo in Paris; IMO and Nikolaj Kunsthal in Copenhagen; Henie Onstad Art Center, Kunstnernes Hus and 0047 in Oslo. Their video work has been screened at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center in New York City; e-flux Berlin; CCA Glasgow and Dundee Contemporary Arts in Scotland; Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit; Museum of Contemporary Art Vojvodina Novi Sad and elsewhere. They have also performed in venues around the world including the Knitting Factory in New York; Overgaden Institute for Contemporary Art in Copenhagen; Museum of Contemporary Art Oslo and MUDAM Luxembourg. INCA. Bergman and Salinas founded the Institute for New Connotative Action (INCA) in Detroit in 2011 and in Seattle in 2013. This artist-run initiative focuses on language as art, particularly emphasizing issues of transformation and translation. As described by Salinas: \"the idea was always to frame INCA the \\'institute\\' as a parody that was also sincere in our mission.\" Bergman and Salinas have curated over 40 exhibitions and events at INCA and have hosted artist\\'s talks, lectures and poetry readings. The artists who have exhibited at INCA include Sondra Perry, Chris Kraus, Henrik Plenge Jakobsen, Cia Rinne, Mikko Kuorinki and Andreas Bunte. Bergman and Salinas say in Temporary Art Review about their motivation for running INCA: We like working with great people. Also, we want to focus attention on the social life of art rather than the objects themselves. In Spain and South America, the \"tertulia\" tradition draws attention to the social life of art and literature without institutional regulation. Our motivation was to produce an independent, quasi-institution that would burn itself out before becoming a self-replicating zombie. In October 2015, INCA was a part of the symposium \"Alternative Currencies: Tactics for Staying Relevant and Radical\" that was held at The Galleries at Moore, Philadelphia. The forum gathered independent contemporary art groups and from around America in a collective exploration of what it means to be (and stay) \"alternative\". Teaching. Bergman was a professor at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts in Norway and both Bergman and Salinas were artists in residence at the University of Washington, and were professors and chair at Pacific Northwest College of Art from 2017-2022. Sound works. Their 2005 album \"Be Mine\" consists of interviews of people talking about love, and the 1999 \"Children\\'s Record\" was made by asking people to sing songs they can remember from their childhood. Their early works are among the first experiments with folk and laptop electronic music. This is especially noted in \"Ruinas Encantadas\" (winner of an honorary mention in Prix Ars Electronica 2001) and \"Porto: Folklore Fragments Volume 2\". The track \"Water Jota in 1213442\" from the former consists almost entirely of water drop sounds, arranged according to the structure of a folk dance; the artists themselves comment on such concepts that the record \"considers the past, while not repeating it.\" In 2002 the duo won an Award of Distinction in Digital Music for their audio installation \"Revisionland\" from the Prix Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria. They have released 12 critically acclaimed full length audio CDs on labels such as Orthlorng Musork, Fat Cat, Tomlab and their own label, Lucky Kitchen.

The foundation was founded in 2003, by Marc Dullaert and Inge Ikink. KidsRights raises funds for independent local aid projects in a number of countries around the world, including India, South Africa and the Philippines. \"KidsRights seeks to give a voice to the utterly voiceless,\" the organisation quotes Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu as saying. The organisation\\'s mission is to support and empower vulnerable children around the world, by raising funds for small-scale local projects, and by raising awareness for children\\'s rights through the international media. The foundation has instituted an annual award, the International Children\\'s Peace Prize, to honour a child who has made a significant contribution to advocating children\\'s rights and improving the situation of vulnerable children. The first Children\\'s Peace Prize was presented in 2005 by Mikhail Gorbachev during the Nobel for Peace Summit in Rome, an annual meeting of Nobel Peace Prize winners. The $10,000 prize was posthumously awarded to Nkosi Johnson, a South African boy who brought attention to children with HIV/AIDS and set up the Nkosi\\'s Haven orphanage. Charitable events to raise funds for KidsRights have been nationally televised in the Netherlands and have featured performances from well-known artists like Andrea Bocelli, Ronan Keating, Ilse de Lange and the Sugababes.

       " 'La Ferté-sous-Jouarre is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne département in the Île-de-France region in north-central France. It is located at a crossing point over the river Marne between Meaux and Château-Thierry. History. This area of France has frequently been a site of warfare. In 1819, British naval officer, Norwich Duff (1792–1862), Edinburgh born, recorded a note on La Ferté. The Bourbon Restoration had apparently dampened the Napoleonic road building boom, as evidenced by unused milestones. Construction projects had rebuilt some facilities destroyed in the wars with Britain and other Powers. La Ferté is famous for millstones used for milling flour. Some have even been found in England. Among notable residents, the artist Émile Bayard was born in this town (1837). The Irish avant-garde writer, dramatist, poet and nobel prize winner Samuel Beckett lived in the neighboring hamlet of Mollien for 36 years. The town\\'s library and secondary school are named after him. André the Giant, three times Worldwide Wrestling champion, icon of the André the Giant Has a Posse (aka Obey) street art project grew up in the local canton. As a child, the American writer and filmmaker Oliver Stone used to spend all his summer holiday at his French maternal grands-parents\\' hotel in La Ferté-sous-Jouarre. The area was invaded and occupied by the Germans from the beginning of the Great War, which led to considerable damage and casualties. After the war, on 14 August 1921, the town of La Ferté-sous-Jouarre was awarded the War Cross with the following citation: On the south-western edge of the town, on the south bank of the river Marne, is the La Ferté-sous-Jouarre memorial, commemorating more than 3000 British soldiers from the Great War with no known grave. They died in fighting in the area against the Germans. Demographics. Inhabitants of La Ferté-sous-Jouarre are called \"Fertois\" in French.',\n",
       " \"The Nobel Prize in Literature is awarded annually by the Swedish Academy to authors for outstanding contributions in the field of literature. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy. The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. As of 2022, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to 119 individuals. The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931. When he received the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did not wish to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature, as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past. However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates. Seventeen women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the second highest number of any of the Nobel Prizes behind the Nobel Peace Prize. There have been four instances in which the award was given to two people (1904, 1917, 1966, 1974). There have been seven years in which the Nobel Prize in Literature was not awarded (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940–1943). There have been three years for which the Nobel Prize in Literature was delayed one year: the prizes for 1915, 1949 and 2018 were each awarded together with that of the following year in October of the following year. As of 2022, there have been 29 English-speaking laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature, followed by French with 16 laureates and German with 14 laureates. France has the highest number of Nobel laureates. Nobel laureates by country. The 119 Nobel laureates in literature from 1901 to 2022 have come from the following countries: Nobel Prize in Literature (by language). 1Rabindranath Tagore (Nobel Prize in Literature 1913) wrote in Bengali and English, Samuel Beckett (Nobel Prize in Literature 1969) wrote in French and English and Joseph Brodsky (Nobel Prize in Literature 1987) wrote poetry in Russian and prose in English. These three Nobel laureates have been sorted under Bengali, French and Russian, respectively. 2Karl Adolph Gjellerup (Nobel Prize in Literature 1917) wrote in Danish and German.

       " \"Amnesty International South Africa (AI SA) is a South African organisation that works to end human rights abuses along with its affiliate organization Amnesty International. Amnesty International South Africa was founded in 1990 and grew from modest beginnings to become a key player in South Africa's transition to democracy and an important part of Amnesty's international movement, hosting the Amnesty International ICM in 1997. Today Amnesty International South Africa continues to campaign on multiple fronts including human rights education, women's rights, arms control and Zimbabwe. History. Amnesty International did not have a group presence in South Africa up to the end of the 1980s because mixed race meeting were not allowed under the apartheid regime. However, there were individual members linked to London. It was only in 1990 when the local situation improved with a reduction in repression and the unbanning of the ANC and its allied organisations, that the International Secretariat allowed the formation of groups in the country. In 1990-1992, four groups started around the country - Port Elizabeth was the first group, followed by Durban, Pietermartizburg and Pretoria. Members from these groups met in 1993 to form a national coordinating committee (some representatives Piotr Nowosad and Linda Stiebel). By that time there were additional groups in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Grahamstown. A national office was opened in Cape Town in 1995 and this moved to Pretoria in 1998. By that time a Board had taken the place of the NCC. A director was appointed for the first time in 2001. Amnesty South Africa's achievements in the 1990s included lobbying to abolish the death penalty; developing a national police human rights training programme focusing on children's rights; and lobbying to stop South African arms sales to states such as Turkey, Rwanda and Burundi, whose human rights records were questionable. In 1995 Pierre Sane, Amnesty International's secretary general, visited South Africa and met the deputy president Thabo Mbeki to discuss human rights abuses in South Africa, Nigeria and the African Great Lakes region. In 1997, Amnesty South Africa hosted the international movement's ICM meeting in Cape Town, also attended by nobel prizewinner Archbishop Desmond Tutu. In 2006 the membership at the AGM voted for the Programme for Growth which allowed the International Mobilisation Fund, based at the International Secretariat, to take over governance and management of the organisation for a period of 2–3 years. Campaigns today. Amnesty International South Africa runs a national human rights education programme , campaigns strongly to stop violence against women and against human rights violations in Zimbabwe . The Darfur conflict in Sudan is one of Amnesty International's top priorities, as a result of the large scale human rights abuses occurring. Amnesty has called for the introduction of a United Nations peacekeeping force to prevent conflict and stop further unnecessary suffering.\",\n",

       " 'Christian Kracht (; born 29 December 1966) is a Swiss author. His books have been translated into more than 30 languages. Personal life. Kracht was born in Saanen in the Canton of Bern. He attended Schule Schloss Salem in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, and Lakefield College School in Ontario, Canada. He graduated from Sarah Lawrence College, New York, in 1989. Kracht\\'s father, Christian Kracht Sr., was chief representative for the Axel Springer publishing company in the 1960s. He has lived for long spells in Buenos Aires, Lamu, Florence, Bangkok, Kathmandu, Landour, Los Angeles and Munich. He is married to German film director Frauke Finsterwalder, with whom he has a daughter who was born in 2010. They live in Zurich. Journalism and collaborative work. Before becoming a novelist, Kracht worked as a journalist for a number of magazines and newspapers in Germany, including \"Der Spiegel\". In the mid-1990s, he lived and worked in New Delhi as Spiegel\\'s Indian correspondent. Kracht then moved to Bangkok, from where he visited various other countries in South East Asia. During this period he authored travel vignettes that were serialised in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper and later collated in the book \"Der Gelbe Bleistift\" (\"The Yellow Pencil\") in 2000. In November 2006 Kracht was a regular columnist for the newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\". His fortnightly column, which originally had the title \"Letter from...\", later changed to \"Letter from the Past\". During this time, together with American businessman David Woodard, Kracht reported on Aleister Crowley\\'s erstwhile residence in Cefalù. Kracht has regularly collaborated with other authors and artists. In 1998 he worked with Eckhart Nickel to co-author \"Ferien für immer\" (\"A permanent vacation\"), collated musings on \"the most pleasant places on earth\". In 1999 Kracht took part in the performance piece \"Tristesse Royale\" with Stuckrad-Barre, Joachim Bessing, Eckhart Nickel and Alexander, Count of Schönburg-Glauchau. The book is an edited transcript of a recording made by the contributors in which they discuss globalised popular culture while staying at Berlin\\'s Hotel Adlon. For some commentators this publication constituted the high-water mark of so-called \"Popliteratur\" – a literary marketing phenomenon for which Kracht was the supposed figurehead. The author has repeatedly distanced himself from this epithet and has, for example, refused permission for his work to be republished in an anthology of that genre. This notwithstanding, Kracht was the editor of the anthology \"Mesopotamia\" – a collection of short stories, fragments and photo montages by authors associated with the pop literature, including Rainald Goetz, Andreas Neumeister and Benjamin von Stuckrad-Barre. First published with the subtitle \"Ernste Geschichten am Ende des Jahrtausends\" (\"Serious stories at the turn of the Millennium\"), this subtitle was dropped in its 2001 republication by Deutsche Taschenbuch Verlag in favour of an \"Avant-Pop-Reader\". The relabeling notably coincided with the deflating currency of the term \"pop literature\" in the early years of the new century. Between September 2004 and June 2006 Kracht published the independent literary magazine \"Der Freund\" in collaboration with Eckhart Nickel. He initially lived in Kathmandu while working as the magazine\\'s editor before leaving Nepal during a period of political unrest. The chiefly German-language magazine was ultimately completed in San Francisco with a total of eight editions as originally planned. The magazine featured regular contributions from Ira Cohen, Reinhold Messner, Ian Buruma, Stanislav Lem, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Rem Koolhaas, Momus, David Woodard and Eduardo Kac. February 2007 saw the publication of \"Metan\" (\"Methane\"), the product of a climbing expedition on Kilimanjaro with Ingo Niermann. The book posits that the effects of methane gas on the earth\\'s atmosphere are part of a vast cosmic conspiracy. Early reviews varied from the critical to the bewildered, one describing it as \"großer Quatsch\" (\"a load of nonsense\"). Another reviewer refers to the book as a parody of \"alarmism\" and suggested it should be taken as a joke: \"But if this book is taken as a joke, it probably is not a bad one\". In 2012 Kracht published an exchange of letters with Woodard entitled \"Five Years\". Although this text is essentially a performance piece, certain episodes in their correspondence were deemed controversial, especially references to Nueva Germania. Indeed, in February 2012, Georg Diez, writing an opinion piece published in \"Der Spiegel\" alleged that \"Five Years\" exposed racist, right-wing sympathies supposedly present in Kracht\\'s latest novel \"Imperium\". This view was widely contested and by established critics and authors alike during a sustained literary debate in German-language newspapers and magazines. Novels. The protagonists of Kracht\\'s fiction embark on journeys that take them in search of an elusive moment of immersive, utopian experience or spiritual enlightenment often located in a different nation or culture. Their journey usually, but not always, results in disappointment, failure or even death. The theme of travel was introduced in Kracht\\'s debut novel \"Faserland\" (1995), a text that is often central in the discussion of German pop literature by literary critics and scholars. While the first wave of the novel\\'s criticism identified \"Faserland\" as a novel about the affirmation of brand names and consumer culture, a second wave of criticism suggested rather that the novels evinces the protagonist\\'s dissatisfaction with his lifestyle and existential \"ennui\". Early criticism of the novel suggested the influence of Bret Easton Ellis on his work, with some commentators even accusing him of plagiarism. Since the critical re-evaluation of \"Faserland\", however, critics have observed the potential influence on his work by younger German-language writers such as Leif Randt with his 2011 novel \"Schimmernder Dunst über Coby County\" (\"The glistening haze over Coby County\"). The setting of Kracht\\'s second novel \"1979\" is Iran and begins in medias res against the backdrop of the revolution of the Ayatollah Khomeini during the titular year. This novel also deals with alienation and a chiefly Western form of consumer existence, but it depicts the fragility of an apparently decadent Western-metropolitan value system and its powerlessness before the Eastern-totalitarian models of Islamism and Maoism. After the supposed frivolousness of \"Faserland\", then, Kracht was now seen as on the way \"towards genuine seriousness\" in his writing – a view held by critics that was no doubt informed by the context of the September 11 attacks with which the novel\\'s publication coincided. Kracht is sceptical about such a reading of his work and argues that he writes literary \"light entertainment\" and \"comedies\". Thus, during a television appearance on the popular Harald Schmidt Show in 2001, Kracht argued that his book was essentially kitsch. The 2008 novel \"Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten\" (\"I will be here in sunshine and in shadow\") imagines an alternative history of the twentieth century in which Lenin never returned to Russia from Switzerland, but instead founded a Swiss Soviet Republic – a Communist state engaged in the colonisation of Africa and in perpetual war with other totalitarian empires, notably with a federation of British and German fascists. Channeling Philip K. Dick\\'s \"The Man in the High Castle\" and Ford Coppola\\'s \"Apocalypse Now\", the plot of the novel traces a black Swiss political commissar\\'s journey to the heart of the empire to arrest the rogue officer Brazhinsky in the \"Réduit\". \"Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten\" quickly garnered acclaim in the German-speaking literary world. Broadsheet \"Die Welt\" called it a \"glorious horror story\". The \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" praised the writing as not only deeply reminiscent of Ernst Jünger, but also as the \"most beautiful German prose currently on offer\". But the \"Frankfurter Rundschau\" reviewer discounted \"Ich werde hier sein\" as \"simply moronic\" and \"Die Tageszeitung\" found the text to be too diffuse and incoherent, amounting to just a \"drug-clouded scenery\" The novel \"Imperium\" and its reception. Kracht\\'s 2012 novel \"Imperium\" follows on from \"Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten\" both in its very favourable reception by critics and in the way that it presents a reimagining of history that incorporates actual persons and historical \"reality\" while playing fast and loose with dates and details. In this sense the novel bears some similarity to \"Die Vermessung der Welt\" (\"Measuring the World\") by Daniel Kehlmann, an author with whom Kracht corresponded while composing the distinctive narrative style of \"Imperium\". The novel follows the travails of the historical figure August Engelhardt in the Bismarck Archipelago (now Papua New Guinea) at the beginning of the twentieth century. Engelhardt is an idealistic German emigrant who establishes a plantation on an island and founds a colony of cocovores – radical vegetarians nourished exclusively on coconuts. Engelhardt\\'s history is interspersed with cameo appearances by other figures from German cultural history, such as Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. The first of Kracht\\'s novels not to be narrated in the first-person, the omniscient narrator informs us of the protagonist\\'s thoughts and contextualises Engelhardt\\'s life within the broader scope of twentieth-century history. \"Imperium\" created a stir in Germany even before its publication. Writing in \"Der Spiegel\", critic Georg Diez suggested that the novel \"above all shows the author\\'s proximity to extreme right-wing ideas\". The accusation of racism levelled at Kracht was widely repudiated by other figures in the literary industry, including publisher Helge Malchow and fellow authors, such as Daniel Kehlmann, Feridun Zaimoğlu, Necla Kelek and nobel prize winner Elfriede Jelinek. Reviews of \"Imperium\" in the German-language press praised the novel\\'s language, and it has been favourably compared to Joseph Conrad\\'s \"Heart of Darkness\" in terms of both theme and style. In 2012, Kracht was awarded the literature prize for the Swiss canton of Bern and also the Wilhelm Raabe literature prize. In the words of the awarding jury, \"Imperium\" \"balances on the border between humour and horror ... with great confidence and so forms a significant twist in the tapestry of contemporary German-language literature\". \"Imperium\" has been translated into over 25 different languages, including English. Style and appearance. Kracht\\'s novels are pastiche; a playful blend of influences appropriated from areas of \"high\" and \"low\" culture. Thus, Kracht\\'s writings contain alienating references to other works, including Thomas Mann\\'s \"Magic Mountain\", the subtly ironic travel journals of Robert Byron, and Hergé\\'s \"The Adventures of Tintin\" series. Furthermore, the \"ligne claire\" drawing style is used for the illustrations (by Dominik Monheim) in the first edition of \"Ferien für immer\" (1998), as well as for \"Der gelbe Bleistift\" (by Hugo Pratt) and the original cover of \"Imperium\". Many of Hugo Pratt\\'s characters, in turn, make their appearance in \"Imperium\". Kracht has attested that a writer also \"always performs being a writer\". His performance is persuasive and has successfully seduced reviewers into sometimes overlooking the distinction between the author and narrator to erroneously identify Kracht as the autobiographical protagonist of his debut novel Faserland. He has sometimes been a controversial figure in modern German-language literature. The meaning of his pronouncements in interviews is not always obvious; his description of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar (and by implication the Taliban itself) as \"camp\" should perhaps be taken with a pinch of salt: in this case moral values take second place after media aesthetics. A similar principle applies to Kracht\\'s foreword to the 2006 illustrated book \"Die totale Erinnerung\" (published with Feral House as \"The Ministry of Truth\" in the U.S.), in which Kim Jong-Il\\'s North Korea is referred to as a gigantic simulation, whereas his apparent ignorance of actual suffering in North Korea upset some commentators. Stage adaptations and screenplay. Since 2004 a stage version of the novel \"1979\", directed by Matthias Hartmann, has been performed in theatres in Zurich, Bochum and Hannover. In 2009 the play was shown at the Burgtheater in Vienna, while a stage version of \"Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten\" has been performed at theatres in Basel, Stuttgart and Berlin. In 2015, a dramatized version of \"Imperium\" premiered at Thalia Theater in Hamburg, Germany. A stage version of \"The Dead (Kracht novel)\" premiered in December 2017 at Bern Theatre in Switzerland\\'s capital. Kracht co-authored the screenplay for the 2013 film \"Finsterworld\", which was directed by his wife Frauke Finsterwalder. The couple also co-wrote the screenplay for Finsterwalder\\'s second feature film, \"Sisi & I\", a biopic about Empress Elisabeth of Austria, premiered at the 73rd Berlin Film Festival on 19 February 2023. Kracht\\'s 2021 novel \"Eurotrash\" was adapted for the stage by Jan Bosse at Schaubühne, Berlin, premiering on 18 November 2021.',\n",
       " 'Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is an ambient ionization technique that can be coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) for chemical analysis of samples at atmospheric conditions. Coupled ionization sources-MS systems are popular in chemical analysis because the individual capabilities of various sources combined with different MS systems allow for chemical determinations of samples. DESI employs a fast-moving charged solvent stream, at an angle relative to the sample surface, to extract analytes from the surfaces and propel the secondary ions toward the mass analyzer. This tandem technique can be used to analyze forensics analyses, pharmaceuticals, plant tissues, fruits, intact biological tissues, enzyme-substrate complexes, metabolites and polymers. Therefore, DESI-MS may be applied in a wide variety of sectors including food and drug administration, pharmaceuticals, environmental monitoring, and biotechnology. History. DESI has been widely studied since its inception in 2004 by Zoltan Takáts, Justin Wiseman and Bogdan Gologan, in Graham Cooks\\' group from Purdue University with the goal of looking into methods that didn\\'t require the sample to be inside of a vacuum. Both DESI and direct analysis in real time (DART) have been largely responsible for the rapid growth in ambient ionization techniques, with a proliferation of more than eighty new techniques being found today. These methods allow for complex systems to be analyzed without preparation and throughputs as high as 45 samples a minute. DESI is a combination of popular techniques, such as, electrospray ionization and surface desorption techniques. Electrospray ionization with mass spectrometry was reported by Malcolm Dole in 1968, but John Bennett Fenn was awarded a nobel prize in chemistry for the development of ESI-MS in the late 1980s. Then in 1999, desorption of open surface and free matrix experiments were reported in the literature utilizing an experiment that was called desorption/ionization on silicon. The combination of these two advancements led to the introduction of DESI and DART as the main ambient ionization techniques that would later become multiple different techniques. One in particular, due to increasing studies into optimization of DESI, is nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). In this technique the analyte is desorbed into a liquid bridge formed between two capillaries and the analysis surface. Principle of operation. DESI is a combination of electrospray (ESI) and desorption (DI) ionization methods. Ionization takes place by directing an electrically charged mist to the sample surface that is a few millimeters away. The electrospray mist is pneumatically directed at the sample where subsequent splashed droplets carry desorbed, ionized analytes. After ionization, the ions travel through air into the atmospheric pressure interface which is connected to the mass spectrometer. DESI is a technique that allows for ambient ionization of a trace sample at atmospheric pressure, with little sample preparation. DESI can be used to investigate in situ, secondary metabolites specifically looking at both spatial and temporal distributions. Ionization mechanism. In DESI there are two kinds of ionization mechanism, one that applies to low molecular weight molecules and another to high molecular weight molecules. High molecular weight molecules, such as proteins and peptides show electrospray like spectra where multiply charged ions are observed. This suggests desorption of the analyte, where multiple charges in the droplet can easily be transferred to the analyte. The charged droplet hits the sample, spreads over a diameter greater than its original diameter, dissolves the protein and rebounces. The droplets travel to the mass spectrometer inlet and are further desolvated. The solvent typically used for the electrospray is a combination of methanol and water. For the low molecular weight molecules, ionization occurs by charge transfer: an electron or a proton. There are three possibilities for the charge transfer. First, charge transfer between a solvent ion and an analyte on the surface. Second, charge transfer between a gas phase ion and analyte on the surface; in this case the solvent ion is evaporated before reaching the sample surface. This is achieved when the spray to surface distance is large. Third, charge transfer between a gas phase ion and a gas phase analyte molecule. This occurs when a sample has a high vapour pressure. The ionization mechanism of low molecular weight molecules in DESI is similar to DART\\'s ionization mechanism, in that there is a charge transfer that occurs in the gas phase. Ionization efficiency. The ionization efficiency of DESI is complex and depends on several parameters such as, surface effects, electrospray parameters, chemical parameters and geometric parameters. Surface effects include chemical composition, temperature and electric potential applied. Electrospray parameters include electrospray voltage, gas and liquid flow rates. Chemical parameters refers to the sprayed solvent composition, e.g. addition of NaCl. Geometric parameters are α, β, d1 and d2 (see figure on the right). Furthermore, α and d1 affect the ionization efficiency, while β and d2 affect the collection efficiency. Results of a test performed on a variety of molecules to determine optimal α and d1 values show that there are two sets of molecules: high molecular weight (proteins, peptides, oligosaccharide etc.) and low molecular weight (diazo dye, stereoids, caffeine, nitroaromatics etc.). The optimal conditions for the high molecular weight group are high incident angles (70-90°) and short d1 distances (1–3\\xa0mm). The optimal conditions for the low molecular weight group are the opposite, low incident angles (35-50°) and long d1 distances (7–10\\xa0mm). These test results indicate that each group of molecules has a different ionization mechanism; described in detail in the Principle of operation section. The sprayer tip and the surface holder are both attached to a 3D moving stage which allow to select specific values for the four geometric parameters: α, β, d1 and d2. Applications. Laser ablation electrospray ionization. Laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) mass spectrometry is an ambient ionization technique applicable to plant and animal tissue imaging, live-cell imaging, and most recently to cell-by-cell imaging. This technique uses a mid-IR laser to ablate the sample which creates a cloud of neutral molecules. This cloud is then hit with the electrospray from above to cause ionization. The desorbed ions are then able to pass into the mass spectrometer for analysis. This method is also good for imaging in applications. The analyses can be desorbed through a pulsed laser irradiation without the need of a matrix. This method is best used with small organic molecules up to larger biomolecules as well. Matrix assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization. Another method good for biomolecules is Matrix assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI). In this technique, it utilizes Infrared laser ionization to excite the sample molecules to allow for the desorbed ions to be ready for MS analysis. The geometry of the source and the distance between the ESI and matrix will have and effect on the efficiency of the sample compound. This technique can also be used with aqueous samples as well. The water droplet can be placed at the focal point of the laser, or the droplet can be dried to form the solid. Planar samples do not need sample preparation to perform this experiment. Ion mobility mass spectrometry. Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is a technique of ion separation in gaseous phases based on their differences in ion mobility when an electric field is applied providing spatial separation prior to MS analysis. With the introduction of DESI as an ion source for ion mobility mass spectrometry, applications for IMS have expanded from only vapor-phase samples with volatile analyses to also intact structures and aqueous samples. When coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, analysis of proteins is also possible. These techniques work in tandem to one another to investigate ion shapes and reactiveness after ionization. A key characteristic of this setup is its ability to separate the distribution of ions generated in DESI prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance. As stated before, DESI allows for a direct investigation of natural samples without needing any sample preparation or chromatographic separation. But, because of this unneeded sample prep the spectrum created maybe very complex. Therefore, you can couple a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance to DESI, allowing for a higher resolution. The DESI can be composed of six linear moving stages and one rotating stage. This can include a 3-D linear stage for samples and another with the rotating stage for the spray mount. Coupling of an FTICR to DESI can increase mass accuracy to below 3 parts per million. This can be done on both liquid and solid samples. Liquid chromatography. DESI can be coupled to ultra-fast liquid chromatography using an LC eluent splitting strategy. It is a strategy through a tiny orifice on an LC capillary tube. There is negligible dead volume and back pressure that allows for almost real time mass spectrometry detection with a fast elution and purification. This coupling can be used to ionize a wide range of molecules, from small organics to high mass proteins. This is different from ESI (electrospray ionization) in that it can be used to directly analyze salt-containing sample solutions without requiring \"make-up\" solvents/ acids to be doped into the sample. This set up allows for a high flow rate without splitting. The high resolution that is accomplished by reverse-phase HPLC can be combined with this procedure to produce high throughput screening of natural products as well. The incorporation of the electrochemistry component helps with ionization efficiency via the electrochemical conversion. This method is proved better than ESI in the fact that you don\\'t have to separate the small potential that is applied to the cell from the potential on the spray in DESI. DESI also shows a better tolerance to inorganic salt electrolytes and you can use traditional solvents used in electrolysis. Instrumentation. In DESI, there is a high-velocity pneumatically assisted electrospray jet that is continually directed towards the probe surface. The jet forms a micrometer-size thin solvent film on the sample where it can be desorbed. The sample can be dislodged by the incoming spray jet allowing for particles to come off in an ejection cone of analyte containing secondary ion droplets. A lot of study is still going into looking at the working principals of DESI but there are still some things known. The erosion diameter of the spray spot formed by DESI is known to be directly tied to the spatial resolution. Both the chemical composition and the texture of the surface will also affect the ionization process. The nebulizing gas used most commonly is N2 set at a typical pressure of 160 psi. The solvent is a combination of methanol and water, sometimes paired with 0.5% acetic acid and at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The surface can be mounted it two different ways, one way consists of a surface holder that can carry 1 x 5\\xa0cm large disposable surface slides that lie on a stainless steel surface. The steel surface has a voltage applied to provide an appropriate surface potential. The surface potential that can be applied is the same at which the sprayer can be set at. The second surface is made with an aluminum block that has a built in heater, this allows for temperature control with temperatures up to 300\\xa0°C with newer stages having built in CCD\\'s and light sources. Their spectra are that similar to ESI. They feature multiply charged ions alkali metal adducts and non covalent complexes that originate from the condensed phase of the sample/solvent interaction. DESI is revealed to have a more gentle ionization condition that leads to a more pronounced tendency for metal adduct formation and a lower specific charging of secondary droplets.',\n",
       " 'The Nobel family ( , ) is a prominent Swedish and Russian family closely related to the history both of Sweden and of Russia in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its legacy includes its outstanding contributions to philanthropy and to the development of the armament industry and of the oil industry. Some of its foremost members are Immanuel Nobel, the younger, engineer developer of underwater naval mines and inventor of the rotary lathe used to produce plywood, Ludvig Nobel, the founder of Branobel and one of the richest and most important men in Russia at his time, and Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite who left the major part of his estate to the creation of the Nobel Prizes. Origins. The Nobel family originated from the village of in Scania, hence the name. The first member was Petrus Olai Nobelius (1655–1707) who married Wendela Rudbeck (1668–1710), daughter of the famous Swedish scientist Olaus Rudbeck the Elder, also known as Olof Rudbeck. Achievements. Members of the Nobel family are known not only for their interest in art but also for their inventive ability, which is sometimes referred to as a \"Rudbeckian\" trait, inherited from their ancestor Olaus Rudbeck, the elder. Immanuel Nobel pioneered the development of underwater mines, designed some of the first steam engines to power Russian ships, installed the first central heating systems in Russian homes and was the first to develop modern plywood (cut with a rotary lathe). One of his sons, Ludvig Nobel, was the founder of The Machine-Building Factory Ludvig Nobel, a great armaments concern and the inventor of the Nobel wheel. Ludvig was also the founder of Branobel, the foremost Russian oil industry of its time, and launched the world\\'s first diesel-driven tugs and tankers, besides building the first European pipeline. Alfred Nobel, who died childless, was the inventor of dynamite and the founder of the Nobel Prizes, to the creation of which he left the bulk of his estate. The Nobel family have created several societies, including the Nobel Family Society, a private society of which only the descendants of Immanuel Nobel, the younger, are eligible as members, the Nobel Foundation, a private society administering the prizes of Alfred Nobel, and the Nobel Charitable Trust. Notably, the Director of the Nobel Foundation, Michael Sohlman, and the elected head of the Nobel family disapproves of the institution of the Nobel Charitable Trust (NCT) The Nobel family is also represented in the Nobel Prizes Award Ceremony, held in Stockholm every year. In 2007, the Nobel family archives kept in the Archives of Lund were inscribed in UNESCO\\'s Memory of the World Register.',\n",
       " 'The School of Biological Sciences is a School within the Faculty Biology, Medicine and Health at The University of Manchester. Biology at University of Manchester and its precursor institutions has gone through a number of reorganizations (see History below), the latest of which was the change from a Faculty of Life Sciences to the current School. Academics. Research. The School, though unitary for teaching, is divided into a number of broadly defined sections for research purposes, these sections consist of: Cellular Systems, Disease Systems, Molecular Systems, Neuro Systems and Tissue Systems. Research in the School is structured into multiple research groups including the following themes: The School hosts a number of research centres, including: the Manchester Centre for Biophysics and Catalysis, the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, the Centre of Excellence in Biopharmaceuticals, the Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine, the Centre for Integrative Mammalian Biology, and the Healing Foundation Centre for Tissue Regeneration. The Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research is a joint endeavour with the Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences of Manchester University and industrial partners. Research Assessment Exercise (2008). The faculty entered research into the units of assessment (UOA) for Biological Sciences and Pre-clinical and Human Biological Sciences. In Biological Sciences 20% of outputs were rated 4* (World Class) and 40% 3* (Internationally Excellent), for 107 category A staff. In the Pre-clinical unit, 20% were rated 4* and 45% 3*, for 72 category A staff. Quality assessment by Grade Point Average (GPA) ranks the faculty 3rd and 2nd in the UK for these units respectively History of biological sciences at the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST. Department of Zoology (Victoria University of Manchester, 1879–1986). Zoology was taught at Manchester since the foundation of Owens College in 1851 when William Crawford Williamson was appointed professor of natural history with responsibilities to teach botany, physiology, geology and zoology. His teaching load was reduced by the creation of independent chairs in geology (1874), and zoology (1879). Williamson embodied a traditional view of natural history, with its strong bias to taxonomic classification. From the 1860s onwards this approach began to change under the influence of German university biologists. The appointment of Arthur Milnes Marshall (1852–1893) as professor of zoology at Owens in 1879 led to the adoption of this \\'new biology\\' approach at Manchester. Marshall had been trained by these methods at Cambridge. Marshall modernised the zoology curriculum, introduced courses in elementary biology and embryology, and lobbied for the establishment of dedicated research laboratories. In 1887, the Beyer laboratories were opened, funded by a local industrialist, C. F. Beyer; they were conveniently placed next to the Manchester Museum. Marshall\\'s career ended when he was killed in a climbing accident. Marshall was succeeded by Sydney Hickson (1859–1940) in 1894 who held the chair until 1926. He was a marine zoologist and an expert in the study of corals. Under Hickson the department saw steady growth in staff and students, with the emergence of distinct research specialisms. On his retirement in 1926, he was succeeded by J. S. Dunkerly (1881–1930) a protozoologist and an authority on Flagellates from the University of Glasgow who died in 1931. Herbert Graham Cannon (1897–1963), previously professor of zoology at Sheffield, was elected to the Beyer chair in his place. In 1948 R. Dennell was appointed professor of experimental zoology. The current holder of the Beyer Chair is Professor Andrew Loudon, who studies biological clocks in animals. During the 1960s and 1980s the work of the Department included J. Gordon Blower\\'s work on the population genetics of millipedes, RR Askew\\'s work on parasitic and other insects, Yalden\\'s on the distribution of fauna in the Peak District National Park and the mammals of Ethiopia, Gabbutt\\'s on the biology of the pseudoscorpions, R. D. Butler\\'s on the contractile systems in protozoa, and Roger Wood\\'s on the genetics of mosquitoes. By the 1980s, it was recognised that some of the distinctions between the traditional biological disciplines were no longer as relevant as in the past and the University instituted a major review of the biological sciences at the University. A working party was established under Professor John Willmott that recommended greater integration in teaching and research between traditional biological disciplines, and a closer relationship between biological and medical departments. This led to the creation of a School of Biological Sciences in 1986, based on four divisions: biochemistry and molecular biology, cell and structural biology, environmental biology and physiological sciences. Nine departments of the faculties of science and medicine were abolished, including Botany and Zoology. Professor A. P. J. (Tony) Trinci (a microbiologist) was the first chairman of the School of Biological Sciences. Fourteen members of the Department of Botany joined the new division of cell and structural biology, and six became part of environmental biology. Professors of Zoology, at the Victoria University of Manchester included Department of Botany (Victoria University of Manchester, 1879–1986). Botany has been also taught at Manchester since 1851 when William Crawford Williamson (1816–1896) was appointed as professor of natural history, anatomy and physiology. Williamson originally taught botany, zoology, geology and comparative anatomy. This teaching burden was reduced with the establishment of chairs in geology (1872) and zoology (1879), and with the creation of the Medical School in 1872 eventually allowing Williamson to concentrate on botany. As in zoology, there was an initial concentration on taxonomy until the newer systematic ideas took hold. New botanical laboratories were added west of the Beyer building in 1911, including a physiological laboratory, and remained in use until the 1970s, when the Department was transferred to the Williamson building. In the 1930s research interests were developed in horticulture, assisted by funds from the Royal Botanical Society of Manchester. A plant geneticist F. W. Sansome (1902–1981) was appointed as lecturer in horticulture in 1935, and land was acquired at Jodrell Bank in Cheshire for experimental research in horticulture. This was later used as the site of the famous Jodrell Bank Observatory and Lovell Telescope. On the formation of the new School of Biological Sciences fourteen members of the Department of Botany joined the new division of cell and structural biology, and six became part of environmental biology. The named chairs on botany included: Harrison Professors of Botany: Barker Professors of Cryptogamic Botany: School of Biological Sciences (Victoria University of Manchester, 1986–2004). In addition to the trend to a less compartmentalised approach to biology the government in the 1980s was cutting spending on universities but trying to preserve engineering and medicine. But ultimately the motivation for reform was an assessment by the UGC that was critical of all biological sciences in Manchester. While Physiology and Anatomy fared best they were only rated as \\'Average\\'. Biochemistry, Botany, and Zoology were all \\'Below Average\\', the lowest rank attributable. Biological science in Manchester not only ranked well below Cambridge, Oxford and the London Colleges but was also worse than its civic university competitors such as Liverpool and Leeds and as well as many newer universities such as Reading, Southampton, Swansea and Leicester. A new School of Biological Sciences was created in 1986 with four new departments: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cell and Structural Biology, Physiological Sciences, and Environmental Biology. In 1993 the departments were combined to create a single department school; Keith Gull, as Head of Biochemistry and Research Dean, was heavily involved in these developments. Concentration on the application of molecular biology techniques to address biological research issues led to a marked improvement in the levels achieved in research and, by extension, teaching as measured by external assessment. This was also reflected in a marked increase in funding from research councils and charities and in the higher profile life sciences gained within the university. Department of Biomolecular Sciences (UMIST, 1959–2004). Known by a number of names during its lifespan, the department was formed as the Department of Biochemistry, under Professor Alan Eddy, in 1959. It was created from the previously-existing Brewing Chemistry department. In the early 1980s the then novel discipline of molecular biology was introduced with the appointment of Paul Broda to a chair in this field, the department subsequently being known as Biochemistry and Applied Molecular Biology (BAMBi). The department was particularly strong in the molecular biology of yeast, under the direction of Stephen Oliver. In 1992 the Oliver group co-ordinated the production of the first complete DNA sequence of an entire chromosome, chromosome III of the yeast \"S. cerevisiae\". The prominence of molecular biology approaches and industrial relevance at UMIST acted to some extent as a paradigm for the reorganisation of biological sciences which took place in the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s at the Victoria University of Manchester; however, medical rather than industrial relevance was to take a more prominent role at the latter institution. Some medically relevant research was also carried out in the UMIST department, which had a leukaemia research unit and a group working on the molecular biology of malaria parasites. During the 1990s biological sciences saw considerable expansion within UMIST, including the creation of new professorial chairs and the appointment of a considerable number of new lecturers. The disciplines of biotechnology and structural biology were especially prominent in the research interests of the new appointments. In this period the name of the department changed, once again, to \\'Biomolecular Sciences\\' (BMS). The research strengths within the Life Sciences at UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester had relatively limited overlap, and were to a degree complementary, when the merger of the two universities took place in 2004. Faculty of Life Sciences (UoM 2004-2016). The Faculty of Life Sciences was one of the four faculties that comprised the University of Manchester. It was established in 2004 from the merger of its constituent departments: Biological Sciences and the Centre for the History of Science, Technology & Medicine in the Victoria University of Manchester and Biomolecular Sciences and Optometry & Neuroscience at UMIST. Uniquely for Manchester it was a faculty consisting of only one school. On 25 June 2015 Manchester University announced the results of a review of the position of life sciences as a separate faculty. In August 2016 the faculty was dismantled in a restructuring exercise, reducing the number of faculties in the university from four to three. The majority of the personnel of the faculty were incorporated into a new Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, with a substantial minority moving to the Faculty of Science and Engineering. The term Life sciences is generally understood to be wider than biology, including for example interdisciplinary areas that lie between biology and medicine. The inclusion of Optmetry and Neuroscience in the Faculty reflects this intention while some other areas generally included in a definition of Life Sciences, such as Biomedical Imaging and Pharmacy, are located in the Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences at Manchester. As of 2008, the Faculty taught 2200 undergraduate students, had 467 postgraduate students and 270 academic staff. In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise the Faculty came 3rd in the UK on the basis of Grade Point Average for Biological Sciences with 107 staff submitted, and 2nd in the UK for Preclinical and Human Biological Sciences with 72 staff submitted. Science communication and public engagement. The Life Sciences Podcast/Broadcast. The School of Biological Sciences had its own long-running podcast (and later video broadcast), where scientists within the faculty are interviewed about their research, as well as recently published high-impact papers, books and events they are involved with. Past guests include established researchers such as professor Daniel Davis, author of \"The Compatibility Gene\"\\', Dr David Kirby, author of \"Lab coats in Hollywood\", Dr. Sheena Cruickshank, winner of the Society of Biology Science Communication award (2013) and nobel prize winner Sir John Sulston. The podcast also features interviews with budding new scientists within the school, including high-achieving undergraduates and PhD students, such as the Manchester iGEM team. The broadcasts later went on to explore broader themes within Life Sciences.',\n",
       " \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, van 't Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. At least 25 laureates have received the Nobel Prize for contributions in the field of organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry. Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of three laureates to be awarded the Nobel Prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 and 1972, and Karl Barry Sharpless, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2001 and 2022, are the others. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962). As of 2022, the prize has been awarded to 189 individuals, including eight women (Maria Skłodowska-Curie being the first to be awarded in 1911). There have been eight years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded (1916, 1917, 1919, 1924, 1933, 1940-1942). There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was delayed for one year. The Prize was not awarded in 1914, as the Nobel Committee for Chemistry decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Theodore William Richards in 1915 and counted as the 1914 prize. This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Fritz Haber in 1919, the 1920 prize awarded to Walther Nernst in 1921, the 1921 prize awarded to Frederick Soddy in 1922, the 1925 prize awarded to Richard Zsigmondy in 1926, the 1927 prize awarded to Heinrich Otto Wieland in 1928, the 1938 prize awarded to Richard Kuhn in 1939, the 1943 prize awarded to George de Hevesy in 1944, and the 1944 prize awarded to Otto Hahn in 1945. In 2020, Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prizes for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 were clustered in just a few disciplines within their broader fields. Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period. References. Notes. A.

       " 'José Ángel Mañas (Madrid, 22 October 1971) is a Spanish writer. Mañas is often included as a member of the generation of neorealist Spanish writers from the 1990s, along with Juan Gracia, Gabriela Bustelo, Ray Loriga and Lucía Etxebarria. His books have been translated into several languages. Books. Mañas achieved popular acclaim upon the publication of his literary debut \"Historias del Kronen\". The novel, a finalist for the Premio Nadal literary prize in 1994, became a cult classic, particularly after the film adaptation by Spanish director Montxo Armendáriz. Three novels similar in style and content followed \"Historias del Kronen\": \"Mensaka\" (1995), \"Ciudad Rayada\" (1998) and \"Sonko95\" (1995). \"Autorretrato con negro de fondo\" (1999), together with \"Historias del Kronen\", form the \"Kronen Tetralogy\" that Mañas wrote about in the note at the end of \"Sonoko95\", as follows: I like to say that these four novels are punk novels or \"nobelas\". I was thinking at that time that \"punk\" —and when I used this concept I had in mind the music of the Ramones and the example of groups like the Velvet Underground— was the best way to describe what I was trying to do in writing. I thought that it was a good comparison that helped bring out the aesthetic qualities —speed, authenticity and rawness— that I aim for in a novel. Over time I continued exploring the possibilities of this brilliant comparison and expanding on the idea, which is turning out to be more serious and useful than I had expected. For me a \"nobela\" melds all of the heteroglossic elements that modern fiction either ignores or puts between quotation marks. All of this \"noise\" —and by \"noise\" I mean anything from bastardized spellings to colloquial mistakes and any kind of slang or language that is usually avoided in literature— is what a real novelist has to turn to if he wants to revitalize and pump new blood into a genre positioned like no other to give artistic shape to living language. Of the novels in the \"Kronan Tetralogy\" \"Sonko95\" stands out for the appearance of some of the most prominent characteristics that would come define to Mañas\\' later works. In this respect, \"Sonko95\" has a lot more to do with \"Soy un escritor frustrado\", 1996, than with \"Historias del Kronen\" and \"Mensaka\". In fact in \"Soy un escritor frustrado\", themes which are absent from José Ángel Mañas\\' first two novels, become permanent fixtures in \"Sonko95\", \"Mundo Burbuja\" (2001) and \"Caso Karen\" (2005), in particular, his meta-literary character. \"Soy un escritor frustrado\" in fact describes his own writing process and he enjoys along the way reflecting on the highs and lows of success, which Mañas himself has famously experienced first hand. In \"Caso Karen\", Mañas rails without mercy against the modern literary scene and its most relevant institutions: authors, agents, publishing houses, prizes and conferences. Like in old pastoral romances, many of the characters from \"Caso Karen\" are depictions of real people: in \"Karen del Korral\" Lucía Etxebarria\\'s personality traits are observed; \"Carina Martinell\" is Carmen Balcells; \"Armando Sala\" is Antonio Gala, etc. Additionally \"Caso Karen\" is structurally Mañas most complex work. In 2007 Manas published his first foray into historic fiction: \"El secreto del Oráculo\" (Ediciones Destino), based on Alexander the Great, was shortlisted for the \\'Espartaco\\' prize for best historical novel. In José Ángel Mañas\\' 2008 novel \"La pella\", the writer has gone back to the style that made him famous, with his return to the world of realism. His first entry outside of the fields of fiction and narrative is \"Un alma en incandescencia\" (2008), a book of aphorisms published by the Riojan publishing house Editorial Buscarini. The book was illustrated and inspired by the French artist Franciam Charlot. Film Adaptations. \"Historias del Kronen\" was Manas\\' first novel made into a movie and the screenplay earned him the respective Goya award. In Montxo Armendáriz\\' adaptation, some of the intellectual references from the novel are missing, such as, the endless appearances of Bret Easton Ellis\\' American Psycho in the conversations between Carlos and Roberto. Salvador García Ruiz realized the film version of \"Mensaka\", which came out in 1998. Mañas\\' novel \"Soy un escritor frustrado\" was made for the big screen with the title \"Imposture\", directed by Patrick Bouchitey, and premiered in 2005, the same year that \"Caso Karen\" was published.',\n",

       " \"Marta Helena Nobel-Oleinikoff (Russian: Марта Людвиговна Нобель-Олейникова), née Marta Helena Nobel (9 October 1881, Saint Petersburg – 1973, Stockholm), was a Russian-Swedish physician and philanthropist and member of the Nobel family. She was the daughter of industrialist and humanitarian Ludvig Nobel and the niece of Alfred Nobel. In 1904, she graduated from the St. Petersburg's Women's Medical Institute, presently First Pavlov State Medical University of St. Peterburg, its Surgery Clinic. She was the head physician of the Branobel war hospital and was awarded the Finnish Winter War Medal in 1940. In 1905, she married a doctor specialist in infectious diseases, professor G. P. Oleinikoff. She was the grandmother of Michael Nobel. Nobel opposed the creation of the Bank of Sweden prize in economics, and stated in a letter to the Nobel Foundation in 1968 that the Nobel family would not allow it to be named a Nobel prize.\",\n",
       " 'Harold Pinter and politics concerns the political views, civic engagement, and political activism of British playwright Harold Pinter (1930–2008), the 2005 Nobel Laureate in Literature. Early political views. In 1948-1949, when he was 18, Pinter opposed the politics of the Cold War, leading to his decision to become a conscientious objector and to refuse to comply with National Service. But he was not a pacifist. He told Billington and others that, if he had been old enough at the time, he would have fought against the Nazis in World War II (\"Harold Pinter\" 21–24, 92, & 286). He seemed to express ambivalence about \"politicians\" in his 1966 \"Paris Review\" interview conducted by Lawrence M. Bensky. Yet, he had actually been an early member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the United Kingdom and also had supported the British Anti-Apartheid Movement (1959–1994), participating in British artists\\' refusal to permit professional productions of their work in South Africa, by signing the \"Public Declaration of Playwrights Against Apartheid\" in 1963 (Hadley) and in subsequent related campaigns (Mbeki; Reddy). Later civic activities and political activism. In the 1979 general election, Pinter voted for the Conservatives, led by Margaret Thatcher, \"as a protest against a strike at the National Theatre that was dogging a production he was directing.\" He later said of this that it was \"the most shameful act of my life\". In his last twenty-five years, Pinter increasingly focused his essays, speeches, interviews, literary readings, and other public appearances directly on contemporary political issues. Pinter strongly opposed the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War, the United States\\' 2001 War in Afghanistan, and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. His political statements have elicited some strong public criticism and even, at times, provoked ridicule and personal attacks. David Edgar (writing in the \"Guardian\") defended Pinter against what he terms Pinter\\'s \"being berated by the belligerati\" like Hari and others, who, unlike his supporters such as Edgar, Sir Tom Stoppard, David Hare, and Václav Havel, felt that Pinter did not \"deserve\" to win the Nobel Prize. In accepting an honorary degree at the University of Turin (27 November 2002), he stated: \"I believe that [the United States] will [attack Iraq] not only to take control of Iraqi oil, but also because the American administration is now a bloodthirsty wild animal. Bombs are its only vocabulary.\" Distinguishing between \"the American administration\" and American citizens, he added the following qualification: \"Many Americans, we know, are horrified by the posture of their government but seem to be helpless\" (\"Various Voices\" [2005] 243). He was very active in the antiwar movement in the United Kingdom, speaking at rallies held by the Stop the War Coalition (StWC). In his various public speeches and other appearances, describing former President of the United States George W. Bush as a \"mass murderer\" and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair as both \"mass-murdering\" and a \"deluded idiot\", Pinter specified that, along with other past U.S. officials, under the Geneva Conventions, they are \"war criminals\". He compared the Bush administration with Adolf Hitler\\'s Nazi Germany, in its striving to attain \"world domination\" through \"Full spectrum dominance\": \"Nazi Germany wanted total domination of Europe and they nearly did it. The US wants total domination of the world and is about to consolidate that. … In a policy document, the US has used the term \\'full-spectrum domination\\', that means control of land, sea, air and space, and that is exactly what\\'s intended and what the US wants to fulfil. They are quite blatant about it.\" Referring to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, in a public reading presented in 2003, Pinter \"blamed \\'millions of totally deluded American people\\' for not staging a mass revolt\" and \"said that because of propaganda and control of the media, millions of Americans believed that every word Mr Bush said was \\'accurate and moral\\'.\" Official political statements. On his official website, Pinter published his remarks to the mass peace protest demonstration held in London on 15 February 2003: \"The United States is a monster out of control. Unless we challenge it with absolute determination American barbarism will destroy the world. The country is run by a bunch of criminal lunatics, with Blair as their hired Christian thug. The planned attack on Iraq is an act of premeditated mass murder\" (\"Speech at Hyde Park\"). Those remarks anticipated his observation in his 2005 Nobel Lecture, \"Art, Truth and Politics\" that whereas Bush, like \"all American presidents\" had hypnotically enlisted \"\\xa0\\'the American people to trust their president in the action he is about to take on behalf of the American people.\\'\\xa0\"; nevertheless, \"Many thousands, if not millions, of people in the United States itself are demonstrably sickened, shamed and angered by their government\\'s actions, but as things stand they are not a coherent political force—yet. But the anxiety, uncertainty and fear which we can see growing daily in the United States is unlikely to diminish\" (21). In accepting the Wilfred Owen Award for Poetry, on 18 March 2005, wondering \"What would Wilfred Owen make of the invasion of Iraq? A bandit act, an act of blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of international law?\", Pinter concluded: \"I believe Wilfred Owen would share our contempt, our revulsion, our nausea and our shame at both the language and the actions of the American and British governments\" (\"Various Voices\" [2005] 247–48). The following year, in March 2006, upon accepting the Europe Theatre Prize, in Turin, Pinter exhorted the mostly European audience \"to resist the power of the United States,\" stating, \"I\\'d like to see Europe echo the example of Latin America in withstanding the economic and political intimidation of the United States. This is a serious responsibility for Europe and all of its citizens.\" Pinter was active in International PEN, serving as a vice president, along with American playwright Arthur Miller. In 1985, Pinter and Miller went to Turkey, on a mission co-sponsored by International PEN and a Helsinki Watch committee to investigate and protest against the torture of imprisoned writers. There he met victims of political oppression and their families. At an American embassy dinner in Ankara, held in Miller\\'s honour, at which Pinter was also an invited guest, speaking on behalf of those imprisoned Turkish writers, Pinter confronted the ambassador with (in Pinter\\'s words) \"the reality ... of electric current on your genitals\": Pinter\\'s outspokenness apparently angered their host, who asked Pinter to leave, and, in solidarity, Miller left the embassy with him. Recounting this episode for a tribute to Miller on his 80th birthday, Pinter concluded: \"Being thrown out of the US embassy in Ankara with Arthur Miller—a voluntary exile—was one of the proudest moments in my life\" (\"Arthur Miller\\'s Socks,\" \"Various Voices\" [2005] 56–57). Pinter\\'s experiences in Turkey and his knowledge of the Turkish suppression of the Kurdish language \"inspired\" his 1988 play \"Mountain Language\". He was also an active member of the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, an organisation describing itself as one which \"campaigns in the UK against the US blockade of Cuba and for the Cuban peoples\\' right to self-determination and sovereignty\". Although conceding that the former Serb leader was \"ruthless and savage\", in 2001 Pinter joined the International Committee to Defend Slobodan Milošević (ICDSM), which appealed for the former Serbian leader to be given a fair trial and for his freedom, signing a related \"Artists\\' Appeal for Milošević\" in 2004. Political activism in his final years. In the last few years of his life, Pinter continued to contribute letters to the editor, essays, speeches, and poetry strongly expressing his artistic and political viewpoints, which were frequently published initially in British periodicals, both in print and electronic media, and distributed and re-distributed extensively over the internet and throughout the blogosphere. These were distributed more widely after his winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005; his subsequent publications and related news accounts cite his status as a Nobel Laureate. Later he continued to sign petitions on behalf of artistic and political causes that he supported. He signed the mission statement of Jews for Justice for Palestinians in 2005 and its full-page advertisement, \"What Is Israel Doing? A Call by Jews in Britain\", published in \"The Times\" on 6 July 2006. He also co-signed an open letter about events in the Middle East dated 19 July 2006, distributed to the press on 21 July 2006, and posted on the website of Noam Chomsky. On 5 February 2007 \"The Independent\" reported that, along with historian Eric Hobsbawm, human rights lawyer Geoffrey Bindman, fashion designer Nicole Farhi, film director Mike Leigh, and actors Stephen Fry and Zoë Wanamaker, among others, Harold Pinter launched the organization Independent Jewish Voices in the United Kingdom \"to represent British Jews ... in response to a perceived pro-Israeli bias in existing Jewish bodies in the UK\", and, according to Hobsbawm, \"as a counter-balance to the uncritical support for Israeli policies by established bodies such as the Board of Deputies of British Jews\" (Hodgson; IJV Declaration). In March 2007 American television interviewer and journalist Charlie Rose conducted \"A Conversation with Harold Pinter\" on \"Charlie Rose\", filmed at the Old Vic, in London, and broadcast on television in the United States on PBS. They discussed highlights of his career and the politics of his life and work. They debated his ongoing opposition to the Iraq War, with Rose challenging some of Pinter\\'s views about the United States. They also discussed some of his other public protests and positions in public controversies, such as that involving the New York Theatre Workshop\\'s cancellation of their production of \"My Name Is Rachel Corrie\", which Pinter viewed as an act of cowardice amounting to self-censorship. In mid-June 2008, opposing \"a police ban on the George Bush Not Welcome Here\" demonstration organized by the Stop the War Coalition (StWC), \"Pinter commented, \\'The ban on the Stop The War Coalition march in protest at the visit of President Bush to this country [England] is a totalitarian act. In what is supposed to be a free country the Coalition has every right to express its views peacefully and openly. This ban is outrageous and makes the term \"democracy\" laughable\\'.\" Retrospective perspective on political aspects of his early works. David Edgar\\'s argument in \"Pinter\\'s Weasels\" that \"The idea that he was a dissenting figure only in later life ignores the politics of his early work,\" echoes Pinter\\'s own retrospective perspective on it. In \"A Play and Its Politics\", an interview conducted by Nicholas Hern in February 1985 and published in the Methuen and Grove Press editions of \"One for the Road\", Pinter described his earlier plays retrospectively from the perspective of the politics of power and the dynamics of oppression. He also expressed such a perspective on his work when he participated in \"Meet the Author\" with Ramona Koval, at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, in Edinburgh, Scotland, on the evening of 25 August 2006. It was his first public appearance in Britain since he had won the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature and his near-death experience in hospital in the first week of December 2005, which had prevented him from going to Stockholm to give his Nobel Lecture in person. Pinter described how he felt while almost dying (as if he were \"drowning\"). After reading an interrogation scene from \"The Birthday Party\", he explained that he \"wanted to say that Goldberg and McCann represented the forces in society who wanted to snuff out dissent, to stifle Stanley\\'s voice, to silence him,\" and that in 1958 \"One thing [the critics who almost unanimously hated the play] got wrong ... was the whole history of stifling, suffocating and destroying dissent. Not too long before, the Gestapo had represented order, discipline, family life, obligation—and anyone who disagreed with that was in trouble.\" In both his writing and his public speaking, McDowell observes, \"Politics\" at \"HaroldPinter.org\". In 2000 Harold Pinter launched his official website, which includes a section specifically devoted to his interest and activities in \"Politics\" with a hyperlinked subsection listing the political organisations and causes that he supported during his lifetime. The site includes some hyperlinks to another section, containing Pinter\\'s politically charged poetry. Prior to his death, these parts of his official website were occasionally updated periodically by his various personal assistants. \"The Harold Pinter Community Discussion Forum\" at \"HaroldPinter.org\" contains threads pertaining to Pinter and politics. Leading up to and after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, these threads became more frequent and at times more heated in nature, particular in reference to Pinter\\'s opposition to that Iraq War, his other political activism and statements relating to it, and his winning of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature. Approval of the election of U.S. President Barack Obama. In the final months of his life, Pinter demonstrated his enthusiastic approval of the election of Barack Obama as U.S. President.

       " 'Electronic Data Systems (EDS) was an American multinational information technology equipment and services company headquartered in Plano, Texas, which was founded in 1962 by Ross Perot. The company was a subsidiary of General Motors from 1984 until it was spun off in 1996. EDS was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2008. History. Electronic Data Systems (EDS) was founded in 1962 by H. Ross Perot, a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and a successful IBM salesman who first-hand observed how inefficiently IBM\\'s customers typically were using their expensive systems. Somewhat to IBM\\'s chagrin, since the company wanted to sell as many computers as possible, Perot made a fortune changing this. An early success was in matching the unused computer time at Southwestern Life Insurance Company with the computing needs of rapidly expanding Collins Radio, both located in Dallas, Texas. Perot knew the inside details of both companies. In its early years, EDS was a pioneer in facilities management – becoming the IT department for many companies – as well as beginning to service banks and provide early support for both Medicaid and Medicare in its home state of Texas. Leading the effort internally was Morton H. Meyerson, who joined the company in 1966 as the company\\'s 54th employee. In 1967, he proposed the business model that eventually became known as \"outsourcing\" and which led to exponential growth for EDS. In the 1970s, EDS expanded initially into more insurance services and later credit unions, and by 1975 revenue topped $100 million and the company began bidding for work internationally. In 1978 EDS expanded into financial markets with the arrival of automated teller machines, electronic funds transfer and real-time point-of-sale terminals. Meyerson was named president in 1979, at which point EDS had revenue of $270 million, was free of debt, and had 8,000 employees. In the 1980s, they expanded into travel services supporting payment services between travel agents and airlines represented by the Air Transport Association of America, and provided large scale contracts for the US military. In 1984, the company was acquired by General Motors for $2.5 billion, with EDS becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of GM. Meyerson remained president and in 1985, the company had a presence in 21 countries with 40,000 employees. Meyerson retired in 1987. During his years of executive leadership, EDS revenue grew to $4 billion a year, and the company grew to 45,000 employees. By the end of the decade, revenue was $5 billion. In 1996, GM spun off EDS as an independent company. In the 1990s, in addition to its existing markets, EDS was entering the telecommunications industry and was providing IT systems in many foreign countries. They were providing information systems for global sporting events including the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In 1994, they signed what was at the time the largest information technology contract with Xerox for $3.2 billion and also bought the New Zealand banking processing company Databank Systems. In 1995 they purchased A.T. Kearney, the world\\'s 4th largest private management consulting firm. In 1996, they became an independent company again and relisted on the New York Stock Exchange. Before the turn of the century they took part in over 1,300 Year 2000 projects. As a part of the move towards being an independent company, EDS asked its employees to assist in the re-branding effort by submitting designs for a new logo. While a design (a square with the \"E\" in it) was selected and used for several years, it was the design of Shawn Downs, an employee in the Charlotte IPC, that was ultimately selected and utilized in the 2000 launch. In 2000, EDS launched a new logo with an award-winning Super Bowl commercial about herding cats. Post-2000, they continued to sign long term, billion dollar contracts with organizations such as Bank of America, American Airlines, General Motors, Kraft Foods and the United States Navy. In 2006 they sold A.T. Kearney in a management buyout. In May 2008, Hewlett-Packard Co. confirmed that it had reached a deal with EDS to acquire the company for $13.9 billion. The deal was completed on August 26, 2008. EDS became an HP business unit and was temporarily renamed \"EDS, an HP company\". Ronald A. Rittenmeyer, EDS Chairman, President, and CEO, remained at the helm and reported to HP CEO Mark Hurd until his retirement. In December 2008, HP announced that Rittenmeyer would retire at the end of the month. As of 2008, EDS employed 300,000 people in 64 countries, the largest locations being the United States, India and the UK. It was ranked as one of the largest service companies on the Fortune 500 list with around 2,000 clients. In September 2009, EDS began going to market as HP Enterprise Services, a name change which came one year after HP announced the acquisition of EDS, and which was a critical milestone as the integration of EDS into HP neared completion. On April 3, 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services merged with Computer Sciences Corporation to form DXC Technology, retaining significant operations from Plano, Texas, and many aspects of EDS. On June 1, 2018, DXC spun off the U.S. public services sector of the business through a Reverse Morris Trust, combining with Vencore and KeyPoint Government Solutions to create a new independent and publicly traded government contractor, Perspecta Inc. Company structure. In 2006, EDS sold their management consulting subsidiary company, A.T. Kearney, in a management buyout and retained interests in five related companies: Acquisitions. In June 2006, EDS acquired a majority holding in MphasiS, a leading applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) services company based in Bangalore, India. In March 2007, EDS acquired RelQ Ltd, a testing company based in Bangalore, India. In November 2007, EDS announced that it had agreed to purchase an approximate 93 percent equity interest in Sabre Corporation, a leading provider of software and services to U.S. state governments, from various sellers, including majority shareholder Accel-KKR, for approximately $420 million in cash. Saber became Saber Government Solutions after merging with other EDS state and local non-healthcare groups. In January 2009, it rebranded as EDS, an HP company. In April 2008, EDS acquired Vistorm Holdings Limited, a provider of information assurance and managed security services based in the U.K. The acquisition will create one of the largest information assurance and managed security services firms in Europe. In May 2008, HP and EDS announced that they had signed a definitive agreement under which HP would purchase EDS at a price of $25.00 per share, or an enterprise value of approximately $13.9 billion. The terms of the transaction were unanimously approved by the HP and EDS boards of directors. The transaction closed on 26 August 2008. The companies\\' collective services businesses, as of the end of each company\\'s 2007 fiscal year, had annual revenues of more than $38 billion and 210,000 employees, doing business in more than 80 countries. In September 2009, HP purchased Lecroix Systems and incorporated it into the infrastructure of EDS to facilitate both in-house and client network security needs. Revenue sources. For 2006, $9.6 billion of revenue came from the Americas (Canada, Latin America, and the United States); $6.4 billion from Europe, Middle East, and Africa; $1.5 billion from Asia-Pacific; Services\\' revenue was: Infrastructure $12 billion, Applications Software $5.9 billion, Business Process Outsourcing $3 billion and all other $421 million. EDS announced the expansion of its SAP consulting practice: By collaborating with SAP on client engagement training and techniques that will drive the long-term growth of its consulting practice, EDS will further enhance its existing SAP capabilities and bring end-to-end SAP consulting and systems integration to the market by early 2008. Additionally, EDS will work closely with SAP\\'s Global Partner and Ecosystem Group for market penetration and value-added customer offerings. Locations. EDS operated in 66 countries, with the largest numbers of employees in the cities of Detroit, Michigan, USA; Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, USA; São Paulo, Brazil; Washington, D.C., USA; Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Rome and Milan, Italy; Paris, France; Adelaide, Australia; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Sydney, Australia; Blackpool, UK; Sacramento, California, USA; Tyneside, UK; Madrid and Barcelona, Spain; Lisbon, Portugal; Antwerp, Belgium and Frankfurt, Germany. Other major facilities were in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, India, Dublin, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom. In 1992 the Plano EDS Headquarters campus comprising two eight-story buildings connected by an upper level bridge of office space was opened. The campus consists of 3,521,000 square feet (327,000 m²) of office and data center space on 270 acres (1.1\\xa0km²) of land. The campus included four Tier-IV data centers, a command center, four clusters of office buildings, a fitness center, a service station, four helipads and a hangar. It is the center of the 2,665 acre (11\\xa0km²) Legacy in Plano real estate development, which EDS built. Sponsorships. EDS sponsored the Premier League association football team Derby County from 1998 to 2001 and was also a second-tier sponsor at the FIFA World Cups in the U.S.A. 1994 and France 1998. EDS was the title sponsor of the PGA Tour\\'s EDS Byron Nelson Championship from 2003 to 2008, played in nearby Irving, Texas. In 2009, it became the HP Byron Nelson Championship. The tournament raises about $6 million each year for youth and family service centers in Dallas, Texas. EDS signed a sponsorship agreement in 2007 with Nobel Media to become a Global Sponsor of the Nobel Prize Series, and with Nobel Web to become its Global Technology Services Partner. The three-year agreement enables EDS to apply its technology expertise for the benefit of the Nobel Prize Series and the organization\\'s Web technologies, including supporting the development of content on nobelprize.org, Nobel\\'s award-winning website. EDS sponsored Formula One team Jaguar Racing and was title sponsor of the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. Services. EDS cataloged its services into three service portfolios; Infrastructure, Applications, and Business Process Outsourcing. Infrastructure services includes maintaining the operation of part or all of a client\\'s computer and communications infrastructure, such as networks, mainframes, \"midrange\" and Web servers, desktops and Laptops, and printers. Applications services involves the developing, integrating, and/or maintaining of applications software for clients. Business process outsourcing includes performing a business function for a client, like payroll, call centers, insurance claims processing, and so forth. Partners. EDS established a number of Business alliances with other companies through its global alliance program. The company has three types of alliances: Agility Alliances, Solution Alliances, and Technology Alliances. The EDS Agility Alliance has worked on a range of projects, notably its Agile Enterprise. Members of the EDS Agility Alliance include Cisco Systems, EMC Corporation, Microsoft, Oracle Corporation, SAP, Sun Microsystems, Symantec, and Xerox. Major clients. Most of EDS\\'s clients were very large companies and governments that need services from a company of EDS\\'s scale. EDS\\'s largest clients included Rolls-Royce plc, General Motors, Bank of America, Arcandor, Kraft, United States Navy, the UK Ministry of Defence and Royal Dutch Shell although General Motors announced plans to move 90% of its IT work back in house over the next 3 to 5 years starting in 2012. EDS formed the National Heritage Insurance Company in 1996. The creation of this subsidiary is to manage Medicare Part B services on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), formerly the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). NHIC handles call center, claims processing and payment, fraud investigations, physician enrollment etc. in many states of the US. Another large EDS client is the United States Navy. In 2000, they won a contract for the creation of a US$9 billion Intranet linking the Navy and the Marine Corps, which was set to late 2006, but on March 24, 2006, was extended to 2010, adding $3 billion to the accumulated contract worth. This initiative is known as the Navy Marine Corps Intranet, or simply NMCI. In 2004, NMCI accounted for about 4% of EDS\\'s revenue. NMCI has been called the largest private network in the world, with approximately 400,000 \"seats\". EDS provided the network, desktops, laptops, servers, telephones, video-conferencing, satellite transceivers, and overall management of the intranet. Following on to the NMCI type of services, EDS in March 2005 won a US$4 billion contract with the UK Ministry of Defence to \"consolidate numerous existing information networks into a single next-generation infrastructure\\xa0... The network will provide seamless interaction between headquarters, battlefield support and the front line, linking about 150,000 desktop terminals and 340,000 users in approximately 2,000 locations\\xa0...\" In February 2008 EDS signed a US$1.3 billion contract with the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, one of the largest IT projects ever undertaken in Asia. This agreement will help the Singapore government achieve a standard desktop, network and messaging/collaboration environment across its public sector by the end of fiscal year 2010. In October 2008, the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) signed a US$111 million contract with EDS. Under this contract, EDS will: conduct worldwide security reviews, deliver certification and accreditation support, provide independent evaluation of United States Department of Defense security policies, and conduct security assessments on DOD operating systems, applications, databases, and networks. DOD and EDS have had a 13-year relationship of providing DISA with a wide range of infrastructure services, hardware and software through the DISA I-Assure and Encore contract vehicles. Of historical significance, just prior to the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, EDS was the IT company that developed the Iranian social security information system. During the 1979 overthrow, several EDS employees were detained by the transitioning government of Iran, causing H. Ross Perot to undertake extraordinary clandestine measures to get these employees out of Iran. These events were recounted in Ken Follett\\'s book \"On Wings of Eagles\". See also. In 1997 EDS signed its largest IT contract to that date, with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for US$3.7 billion (approx AU$5bn at the prevailing exchange rate).',\n",
       " 'An imaging biomarker is a biologic feature, or biomarker detectable in an image. In medicine, an imaging biomarker is a feature of an image relevant to a patient\\'s diagnosis. For example, a number of biomarkers are frequently used to determine risk of lung cancer. First, a simple lesion in the lung detected by X-ray, CT, or MRI can lead to the suspicion of a neoplasm. The lesion itself serves as a biomarker, but the minute details of the lesion serve as biomarkers as well, and can collectively be used to assess the risk of neoplasm. Some of the imaging biomarkers used in lung nodule assessment include size, spiculation, calcification, cavitation, location within the lung, rate of growth, and rate of metabolism. Each piece of information from the image represents a probability. Spiculation increases the probability of the lesion being cancer. A slow rate of growth indicates benignity. These variables can be added to the patient\\'s history, physical exam, laboratory tests, and pathology to reach a proposed diagnosis. Imaging biomarkers can be measured using several techniques, such as CT, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and MRI. History. Imaging biomarkers are as old as the X-ray itself. A feature of a radiograph that represent some kind of pathology was first coined \"Roentgen signs\" after Wilhelm Röntgen, the discoverer of the X-ray. As the field of medical imaging developed and expanded to include numerous imaging modalities, imaging biomarkers have grown as well, in both quantity and complexity as finally in chemical imaging. Quantitative imaging biomarkers. A quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIB) is \"an objective characteristic derived from an in vivo image measured on a ratio or interval scale as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or a response to a therapeutic intervention\". advantage of QIB\\'s over qualitative imaging biomarkers is that they are better suited to be used for follow-up of patients or in clinical trials. Examples of a frequently used QIB are the RECIST criteria, measuring the evolution in tumor size to assess treatment response for patients with cancer, the Nuchal scan used for prenatal screening, or the assessment of lesion load and brain atrophy for patients with multiple sclerosis. Use in clinical trials. Clinical trials are known to be one of the most valuable sources of data in evidence-based medicine. For a pharmaceutical, device, or procedure to be approved for regular use in the U.S., it must be rigorously tested in clinical trials, and demonstrate sufficient efficacy. Unfortunately clinical trials are also extremely expensive and time consuming. End-points, such as morbidity and mortality, are used as measures to compare groups within a clinical trial. The most basic endpoint used in clinical trials, mortality, requires years and sometimes decades of follow-up to sufficiently assess. Morbidity, although potentially faster to measure than mortality, can also be a very difficult endpoint to measure clinically, as it is often very subjective. These are some of the reasons why biomarkers have been increasingly used in clinical trials to detect subtle changes in physiology and pathology before they can are detected clinically. The biomarkers act as surrogate endpoints. The use of surrogate endpoints has been shown to significantly decrease the time and resources used in clinical trials. Because surrogate end-points allow researchers to assess a marker rather than the patient, it allows participants to act as their own control, and in many cases allows for easier blinding. In addition to surrogate endpoints, imaging biomarkers can be used as \"predictive classifiers\", to assist in selecting appropriate candidates for particular treatment. Predictive classifiers are frequently used in molecular imaging in order to ensure enzymatic response to treatment. FDA approval of surrogate end-points. The United States Congress and the Food and Drug Administration have acknowledged the value of imaging biomarkers as evidenced by recent actions that encourage their use. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 was instituted to improve the regulatory process for medical products. Section 112 of the Act gives explicit authority to give expedited approval for drugs that treat serious conditions as long as it has shown to have an effect on a surrogate end-point that reasonably indicates a clinical benefit. Other provisions enables monitoring of the products following market approval to ensure the efficacy of the surrogate end-points and requires the FDA to establish a program that promotes the development and use of surrogate end-points for serious diseases. Although the act does not specifically mention the use of surrogate end-points for medical devices, section 205 requires that the \"least burdensome means necessary\" be used in their approval. The wording is much more general than the provision for pharmaceuticals, but is generally accepted that surrogate endpoints will often qualify as being the \"least burdensome means\". Qualification and validation. Developing an understanding of clinical significance for specific biomarkers can be a difficult process. There are two steps of certification for a surrogate endpoint to be fully established: Qualification and Validation. For a biomarker to become qualified it must go through a somewhat formal qualification process. A request must be submitted to IPRG to qualify an imaging biomarker for a specific use. The Biomarker Qualification Review Team, recruited from nonclinical and clinical review divisions, assesses the context and available data regarding the biomarker. They also evaluate the qualification study strategy methods and results and ultimately make a decision to accept or reject. After qualification, a biomarker may have limited use as a surrogate endpoint. They may be used in phase I and II clinical trials, but can only be used in phase III trials for early futility analyses. There are two steps to validation, probable validation and known validation. \"Probable validation\" requires widespread agreement in the medical or scientific community as to its efficacy. \"Known validation\" requires a scientific framework or body of evidence that appears to elucidate the marker\\'s efficacy. For full validation, a biomarker must demonstrate that the treatment versus control differences are similar to the treatment versus control differences for clinical outcome. It is not sufficient to simply demonstrate that the biomarker responders survive longer than the biomarker non-responders. Quality. The following are 3 measures of quality to determine the strength of biomarker for use in clinical trials. Organizations. Because the project of compiling a library of validated biomarkers requires an enormous amount of resources, the FDA has encouraged the creation of consortia between public and private organization in order to facilitate the sharing of data for the qualification and validation of biomarkers. The Biomarkers Consortium was created by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Health, Food and Drug Administration, and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. It is a public-private biomedical research partnership aimed to provide grants for the generation of data for clinical biomarker qualification. The Predictive Safety Testing Consortium, was created by the Critical Path Institute and the Food and Drug Administration to develop a framework needed for data sharing between its members in order to make biomarker qualification easier. They are also working with regulatory agencies to replace the currently unstructured qualification process. In 2001, the Radiology department at Massachusetts General Hospital, founded the MGH Center for Biomarkers in Imaging, a center dedicated to encourage the development and use of imaging biomarkers. Their initial project was to catalogue the known biomarkers in order to make them readily available to scientists, regulators, and industry representatives (now available on their website). The catalogue includes the pathology specific to the biomarkers, the investigator involved in creating and using the biomarker, and the modalities used in the detection of the biomarker. International Cancer Biomarker Consortium was created to assist in discovery of biomarkers by facilitating coordinated research and by leveraging resources. Each international team chooses a cancer site for study, functions independently, and secures its own funding. The president of the organization, Leland Hartwell, is a nobel prize winner for physiology/medicine in 2001. Uniform Protocols for Imaging in Clinical Trials (UPICT) was created by the American College of Radiology. Imaging Response Assessment Teams was created by the National Cancer Institute and AACI to advance the role of imaging in assessment of response to therapy and to increase the application of quantitative, anatomic, functional, and molecular imaging endpoints in clinical therapeutic trials. Aims to strengthen clinical collaboration between imaging scientists and oncologic investigators. Oncology Biomarker Qualification Initiative was created by the Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute to qualify new cancer biomarkers. Their first project involves PET imaging in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.',\n",

       " 'Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien (College of Physicians in Vienna) is a medical society with a long-standing tradition in Austria. Its principal task is the continuing education of medical practitioners. The society\\'s headquarter is the Billrothhaus in the 9th district of Vienna. The organization\\'s main task is the education of medics and the presentation of new scientific findings in the field of medicine. For this purpose, the Gesellschaft der Ärzte organizes scientific events, runs a library and publishes educational videos. After the incumbent President Helmut Sinzinger has died in early 2020, Beatrix Volc-Platzer was elected as the first female President of the College of Physicians in Vienna in October 2020. History. Early stages. 35 years prior to the foundation of the Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien, young physicians met to discuss relevant scientific information. These meetings were the basis for the society\\'s formation. The \"Ärztevereinigung\" (physician\\'s club) was founded in 1802 by Johann Anton Heidmann (1775–1855). Its members subscribed to medical journals then passed them on to other members. The scientific results where discussed during weekly meetings in the apartment of Dr. Heidmann and, after 1804, that of Dr. Malfatti. Other famous members of the club were Ludwig Freiherr von Türkheim, Franz Wirer and Johann Friedrich Osiander. This association published a yearly journal, the \"Gesundheitstaschenbuch\" (Health Manual). The \"Ärzteforum\" (physicians\\' forum) was founded in the early 1830s and had very renowned medics amongst its members, including Ignaz Rudolf Bischoff, university professor at the Josephinum in Vienna, Johann Hassinger, who later was deemed surgeon general, Heinrich Herzfelder, later the Chief Physician in the Israelite Hospital, Ludwig Wilhelm Mauthner von Mauthstein, founder of St. Anna children\\'s hospital and the first professor of pediatrics, as well as the practicing physician Rudolph von Vivenot. Beginnings of the Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien. Franz Wirer and Ludwig Türkheim, who both were rectors at the University, are considered \"the founding fathers\" of the organization; however, this was not possible until the privy councilor Andreas Joseph von Stifft, who was against the creation of the society, died. Their main goal by creating the Gesellschaft der Ärzte was to promote the health sciences as art and science, prior to the goals of the Ärztevereinigung. Additionally, they hoped to use it as a platform to formulate their response to the ongoing cholera epidemic. Over time, their objectives changed. In 1839, the society changed its focus to promoting drug sciences. The foundation of the Royal Academy of Sciences (\"Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften\") in 1847 also helped to promote the medical sciences. While the theoretical subjects such as physics, chemistry, anatomy and biology were discussed in the academy and published in its journal \"Denkschrift\", the College of Physicians focused on pathology, experimental anatomy, medical chemistry and, in particular, clinical medicine. It is due to the influence of the academy and the college that the faculty of medicine broadened their limited scope beyond medical education and focused increasingly on science and research. In 1837, the foundation of the society was finally officially approved. The charter members were of course Franz Wirer and Ludwig Turkheim, as well as Johann Malfatti, the general practitioners Gerhard Brants and Joseph von Vering, the director of the general hospital Franz Xaver Güntner, the professor of pathology and pharmacy Leopold Franz Hermann, the climatologist Rudolph von Vivenot, the president of the faculty Johann Nepomuk von Raimann and the professors of the Josephinic Academy Friedrich Jäger von Jaxtthal and Ignaz Rudolf Bischoff. The first president was Johann Malfatti, who was succeeded by Franz Wirer in 1841. The number of members was at first regulated to a maximum of 40 but raised over time (100 members in 1839, 200 members in 1859). One of the goals of the society was to establish and nurture a library. Today, it has one of the largest private medical-scientific book collections in the world. The first librarian of the yet-to-be-built library, circa 1840, was the district physician Hermann Hieronymus Beer. The first significant contribution was made by the second president of the society, Franz Wirer, who bequeathed his private book collection to the Gesellschaft der Ärzte after his death. All the scientific meetings of the society where documented and published in \"Zeitschrift der k.k. Gesellschaft der Ärzte\" and later in \"Wiener klinische Wochenschrift\". Under the presidency of Franz Wirer, the members were divided into four sections: pharmacology, pathology, hygiene and therapy. The members were free to choose their affiliation. This compartmentalization led to an increased number of meetings, as many as 45 per year. After the disbanding of the sections, the frequency decreased to 25 to 35 meetings per year. Second medical school. After Carl Rokitansky was elected president of the society, in 1850, the association focused increasingly on the natural sciences, leading to a new direction for medicine and to the dawning the new era of the Second Medical School (Zweite Wiener Medizinische Schule). The transition towards education is strictly linked to Carl Rokitansky, Joseph Skoda and Ferdindand Hebra. It marks the elevated status of medicine from the philosophic era to one in which scientific discoveries and clinical manifestations were correlated to pathological findings. During World War I, the frequency of scientific meetings decreased due to difficulties, and addressed mainly plagues, diseases and injuries caused by the war. Under the National Socialist Regime a law was pushed through in 1938 which stated that any organization had to be led by national socialists. This law marked the abolition of the Gesellschaft der Ärzte. The commissarial conductor of this time was a member of the NSDAP, Adolf Irtl. A few weeks later, the \"Wiener Medizinische Gesellschaft\" (Viennese Medical Society) was founded, and Otto Planner-Plan was appointed as chairman. It basically assumed all tasks from the College of Physicians, but, due to the war, meetings were rare. After World War II. The end of World War II was equivalent to the abolition of the Wiener Medizinische Gesellschaft. Leopold Arzt, the chairman of the university\\'s dermatology clinic, began to rebuild the Gesellschaft der Ärzte. Some of the property of the organization was lost during the war. The library had been moved to a barn in the very north of Austria to protect it from air raids. However, it was under threat from humidity and theft. The Billrothhaus also suffered damage from the war. Thanks to the members funds for both the repairs and the library retrieval were amassed. The society was re-established and officially approved in April 1946. Wolfgang Denk was elected president. Springer publishing took over the publication of the \"Wiener klinische Wochenschrift\", which had been discontinued in 1945. Karl Hermann Spitzy, who gained international renown for his work with penicillin, was president from 1982 to 1991. Franz Kainberger, who is leading the organization today, assumed the presidency after Karl Heinz Tragl, who served from 2007 to 2011. Radiologist Walter Hruby was president from 2015 to 2019. Since March 2019 Helmut Sinzinger (specialist in nuclear medicine) is the current president. Sinzinger died on February 21, 2020. Beatrix Volc-Platzer was elected as the first female President of the College of Physicians in Vienna in October 2020. Science and community medicine. Scientific meetings. The most important function of the College of Physicians is the organization of lectures and discussion forums which showcase important health topics and new scientific findings. In the immediate post-war years, the college focused on infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, typhus, pest, pox, erysipelas, rabies but more than anything else, the cholera epidemic. Some of the members\\' important discoveries even made their way into hospital routine. Karl Eduard Hammerschmidt presented a sphygmometer in 1843, an innovative device to analyze the heartbeat and the arterial pulse. The section of pharmacology contributed to the creation of an Apothecaries Act for the Kaiserstaat Austria, to prevent materialists and spice merchants from selling drugs. Many lectures dealt with childbed fever which was dreaded due to its high mortality rate. Johann Klein played an important role in these discussions. The medical students under his supervision used to visit the obstetrics ward directly after leaving the autopsy site, without washing their hands. Klein had several arguments with Ignaz Semmelweis, who attributed childbed fever to this behavior. In 1845 and 1848 the society\\'s journal \"Zeitschrift der k.k. Gesellschaft der Ärzte\" published articles which encouraged all physicians to follow Semmelweis\\' recommendations. In 1850 Ignaz Semmelweis gave a lecture and reported his findings to the society\\'s members. To handle increasing demand of water in Vienna, the College of Physicians initiated the \"Drei-Quellen-Projekt\" (Three Springs Project), which made it possible to access water from surrounding springs. The project was officially introduced by Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1873. As the percent of Vienna\\'s population with clean water rose, there was a drastic decline in cholera cases. In addition to infectious diseases, the post-WW II society focused on the progress in antibiotics, radiotherapy, surgery and cortisone for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Since 2000, the lectures have also addressed the study of medicine in Austria because the educational system came under fire. Therapy. Following a discussion about quackery, the medical profession was forced to become more rigorous in clinical practice. The College of Physicians is responsible for two prominent therapeutic progresses: one is the application of electric current in therapeutic measures, the other is the establishment of a laboratory for chemical analysis in the Vienna General Hospital. This laboratory opened the gate to a large number of scientific discoveries, such as the pathomechanism of diabetes. Florian Heller presented a reagent to measure the sugar level in urine, which was subsequently adopted into hospital routine. By 1874, the laboratory had become a state-of-the-art chemical analysis unit, and after 1889, through the influence of Ernst Freud, advanced further, becoming an innovative research institute which developed techniques pertaining to blood coagulation, cell membranes, gastric autodigestion, the effect of insulin and other biologic processes. During this time, significant progress was also made in the areas of microbiology and surgery. Carl Koller discovered the anesthetic effect of cocaine and Ludwig Türck, who later became the first tenured professor of laryngology, invented a laryngoscope and marked the birth of endoscopy. This first endoscope was continuously refined, and in 1879, the Nietze-Leiter-cystoscope, which is used to examine the urinary bladder, was presented in a meeting of the College of Physicians. Further modifications made the first esophago- and gastroscopy, by Carl Stoerk and Joseph Leiter, possible. Subsequently, Johann von Mikulicz perfected the device. using it to make the first endoscopic diagnosis of gastric cancer. Another project initiated by the college was the foundation of a hospital in Mariahilf - Vienna\\'s sixth district. Although the construction was approved and initiated, it was halted by World War I. Robert Koch discovered the tuberculosis pathogen, which led to enormous progress in the battle against this disease. The College of Physicians established a committee for prevention and therapy of tuberculosis and finally published a report with four crucial points: informing the population, reducing exposure to pathogens by improving equipment hygiene, preventing infection, establishing diagnostic and treatment methods through bacteriological tests, by isolating people exposed to tuberculosis, and providing work. In 1896, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen wrote a letter to Franz Exner and informed him of his finding - the X-ray. This led to intensive research in this field. A few days later (even before Röntgen had a chance to present his findings in Würzburg), the College of Physicians presented the first radiograph of a shotgun injury. The first radiologic atlas was published by Josef Maria Eder and Eduard Valenta in February 1896. Even the first angiogram was produced in Vienna by Eduard Haschek and the idea to use X-rays in radiotherapy came from Leopold Freund, who very successfully treated a naevus with it. Research. In 1901, the journal \"Wiener klinische Wochenschrift\" published an article by Karl Landsteiner entitled \"Über Agglutinationserscheinungen normalen menschlichen Blutes\", which is seen as the foundation of grouping; this changed the picture in medicine completely. For the discovery of the AB0 blood group system, Landsteiner received the nobel prize in 1939. Location. The meetings of the society initially took place in the consistory room at the old university. At this point it was not possible to establish a much needed library. Due to the growing audience, the society moved to the 4th floor of the Domkapitel at Stephansplatz in 1841, where a library and a reading room could be built. the group relocated many times again until 1855, when the government provided a gratis flat for them at Teinfaltstraße; this was the society\\'s headquarter for the next forty years. The last relocation occurred on July 23, 1893, into a new building, Frankgasse 8, named after Theodor Billroth. Today, the Billrothhaus remains the headquarter of the College of Physicians, also housing the society\\'s library. Library. The library was one of the primary goals of the association. Since its foundation, the collection has grown, through donations and swaps, as well as contributions by members. Today, the Billrothhaus library is one of the most precious book collections worldwide. Awards. he College of Physicians awards persons who render outstanding services to medicine. Wilhelm-Auerswald Prize. This prize is awarded biannually in appreciation of the physiologist Wilhelm Auerswald for the best thesis from an Austrian medical faculty. Otto-Kraupp Preis. In honor of Otto Kraupp, this prize was established in 1999. It is awarded annually to the graduate with the best medical dissertation in an Austrian University. Theodor-Billroth Medal.

       " ' Chemical elements may be named from various sources: sometimes based on the person who discovered it, or the place it was discovered. Some have Latin or Greek roots deriving from something related to the element, for example some use to which it may have been put. Known elements. All 118 discovered elements are confirmed and have a formal name and symbol, as decided by IUPAC. The last four names and symbols were added on November 28, 2016. Currently there are no unconfirmed discoveries and all seven periods (rows) of the periodic table are completed. Etymology. Element names can refer to: People. Chemical elements are sometimes named after people, especially the synthetic elements discovered (created) after . Very few are named after their discoverers, and only two have been named after living people: the element seaborgium was named after Glenn Seaborg, who was alive at the time of naming in 1997; and in 2016 oganesson was named after Yuri Oganessian (still living ). Many of the transuranic elements are named after recipients of the Nobel Prize: Other transuranic elements are named after scientists who did not receive the prize: The transuranic element flerovium was named after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, which in turn was named after Georgy Flyorov. The IUPAC stated that the element was named after the laboratory, not Flyorov, but Yuri Oganessian, who led the team at the laboratory that discovered the element, said that the intention of the naming was to honour Flyorov. The element samarium is named after Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets, and gadolinium is indirectly named (via the mineral gadolinite) after Johan Gadolin. Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who named the element gallium after his native land of France (from Latin \"Gallia\" meaning Gaul) denied that the element\\'s naming was for a pun on his own name (\"le coq\" means \"the rooster\" in French, as does \"gallus\" in Latin). Places on earth. Some chemical elements are named after places on the planet earth. Elements which are named after currently existing countries and cities are as: Several places in Scandinavia have elements named after them. A number of other elements are named after classical words for various places. Astronomical objects. The naming of elements from astronomical objects stems from the ancient association of metals with the various planets and their gods, as follows: mercury with Mercury; copper with Venus; iron with Mars (named for the Roman god of war); tin with Jupiter (named for the Roman king of the gods); and lead with Saturn (named for the ancient, slow god who was the father of Jupiter). The Sun and the Moon were associated with gold and silver, respectively. A few other elements are directly named for astronomical bodies, including planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, the Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. Uranium, neptunium, plutonium, cerium, and palladium were named after Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Ceres, and Pallas, respectively. The name selenium comes from the Greek word for the Moon (Σελήνη, \"Selene\"). Similarly, the name helium is derived from the Greek word for the Sun (Ἢλιος, \"Helios\"), as the first evidence for helium came in the form of distinctive emission lines from the Sun that were not explainable by any of the known elements in the 1870s. Tellurium is named after the Latin word \"tellus,\" meaning \"earth\". Minerals. Many elements are named after the minerals in which they are found, e.g. calcium after Latin \"calx\" (lime), silicon is named after Latin \"silex\" (sand), sodium after soda and potassium after potash. Temporary names. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations for their systematic element names to be used for yet unnamed or undiscovered elements as a placeholder, until the discovery of the element is confirmed and a permanent name is decided on. The recommendations are mostly ignored among scientists, who simply call these elements by their atomic number, for example \"element 119\" (instead of \"ununennium\"), with the symbol of \"(119)\" or even simply \"119\". Since 2002, the IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division has been the official body responsible with assigning official names to new elements, with the IUPAC Council making the final decision. Suffixes. There are some standard suffixes for the element names. The suffix \"-ium\", or less commonly \"-um\", usually denotes a metallic element, or at least one that was thought to be metallic when it was discovered (helium is not a metal, and germanium, selenium, and tellurium are more typically termed metalloids or nonmetals). It arose from the Latin suffix of metals such as \"aurum\" (gold) and \"ferrum\" (iron). The suffix \"-on\" is used by some nonmetals (boron, carbon, silicon) as well as the noble gases from neon downward. For the noble gases, it arises from the Greek-adjective names of the stable noble gases (neon, argon, krypton, and xenon), with radon matching its source radium as well as adding the \"-on\" suffix. For the nonmetals, the \"-on\" was generalised to boron and silicon from the ending of \"carbon\". The \"-ine\" suffix is used only for the halogens, with chlorine being named first, and the others being named to match. The suffix \"-gen\" is used for three other nonmetals forming diatomic molecules (hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen). Suffixes were used more inconsistently before 1784, with tungsten (discovered 1783) the last element discovered whose English name lacks a standard suffix. The naming rules promulgated by IUPAC in 2002 declared that all newly discovered elements should have names ending in \"-ium\", for linguistic consistency. In 2016, this was amended so that elements in the halogen and noble gas groups would receive the traditional \"-ine\" and \"-on\" suffixes. This amendment was put into practice for tennessine (element 117) and oganesson (element 118); it was noted that the 2002 recommendations had apparently not anticipated that these elements would be reached as quickly as they were. Chemical symbol. Once an element has been named, a one-, or two-letter symbol must be ascribed to it so it can be easily referred to in such contexts as the periodic table. The first letter is always capitalised. While the symbol is often a contraction of the element\\'s name, it may sometimes not match the element\\'s name when the symbol is based on non-English words; examples include \"Pb\" for lead (from \"plumbum\" in Latin) or \"W\" for tungsten (from \"Wolfram\" in German). Elements which have only temporary systematic names are given temporary three-letter symbols (e.g. Uue for ununennium, the undiscovered element 119). Naming controversies. The naming of the synthetic elements dubnium and seaborgium generated a significant amount of controversy, referred to as the Transfermium Wars. The Americans wished to name element 105 hahnium, while the Russians preferred the name dubnium. The Americans also wished to name element 106 seaborgium. This naming dispute ran from the 1970s (when the elements were discovered) to the 1990s, when the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) created a tentative list of the element names for elements 104 to 109. The Americans, however, refused to agree with these names because seaborgium was not in the list. Thus, IUPAC reconsidered, and in 1996 named element 105 dubnium and element 106 seaborgium. In the past, elements would sometimes be renamed if the original discovery claim was successfully challenged: this occurred for elements 43 (technetium replacing masurium), 61 (promethium replacing illinium), and 85 (astatine replacing alabamine). To avoid confusion, this is no longer done, e.g. element 102 is still called nobelium even though that discovery claim was refuted. Alternative forms of an element, names indicating molecular structure, and names of compounds. When a pure element, comprising only one type of atom, nevertheless exists in multiple forms (allotropes) with different structure and properties, they are generally given different names; for example graphite and diamond are both forms of the element carbon. Even for elements such as nitrogen having only one stable allotrope, a name such as dinitrogen may be used to indicate its molecular structure N2 as well as its elemental composition. The naming of chemical compounds comprising more than one element is a complex subject, discussed at length in the article on chemical nomenclature.',\n",
       " 'The Gladiator is a tragic melodrama in five acts written by Robert Montgomery Bird originally starring Edwin Forrest. It first premiered on September 26, 1831, at the Park Theatre in New York City. Background. This theatrical piece was written at the request of Edwin Forrest, an American actor seeking to further his career. He wanted to solidify his fame by acquiring the rights to perform in plays customized to highlight his talents and physical attributes so he devised a contest to encouraged dramaturgs to author new works in return for a cash price. Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags, a play by John Augustus Stone won Forrest\\'s inaugural play prize in 1829. A huge success, \"Metamora\" inspired Forrest to continue offering the prize. Robert Montgomery Bird, a doctor without \"an all-consuming passion for medicine,\" hearing of the prize, penned and submitted his first play, the blank verse tragedy \"Pelopidas, or The Fall of the Polemarchs\". Although \"Pelopidas\" won the prize, it was not produced or published until 1919, possibly because Pelopidas does not dominate the action of his play in the way Metamora managed and therefore failed to show off Forrest\\'s abilities adequately. However, Forrest found it well written and encouraged a second submission by Bird. The following year, Bird won Forrest\\'s prize a second time with that play that would become his most impactful, \"The Gladiator\". Bird\\'s brother Henry, in a letter advised Robert to continue with \"The Gladiator\" as Spartacus was \"altogether more suited to Forrest\\'s Roman figure & actions.\" In fact, it turned out to be the perfect vehicle to showcase Forrest\\'s \"muscular acting style\" . Thanks to \"The Gladiator\", Forrest became \"the most famous American actor of his day\". Synopsis. \"The Gladiator\" tells the story of a man yearning to live freely and removed from the oppression of totalitarian masters. Spartacus is a gladiator who initially refuses to fight because he will not \"slay a man for the diversion of Romans\". The play opens with Phasarius, a Thracian slave and other gladiators decrying the position of Rome and considering a revolt against the state left vulnerable by its colonizing and war-mongering generals. However, upon heading from his lanista, Bracchius, that a newly captured Thracian gladiator is an even better fighter than himself, Phasarius resolves to postpone his plans for coup. This newly captured slave is Spartacus, who agrees to battle so that he may free his also captured wife and child. He barters his services, \"I will serve you Better than slave e\\'er served\", in exchange for his family, \"Keep us together\". Upon meeting each other in the arena of the amphitheater, however, Phasarius and Spartacus recognize each other as brothers, refuse to fight and incite their fellow gladiators to revolt. They proclaim, \"Death to the Roman fiends, that make their mirth Out of the groans of bleeding misery! Ho, slaves, arise! it is your hour to kill! Kill and spare not -For wrath and liberty!-\" War ensues. The gladiator army, led by Spartacus is initially successful in their crusade against the Romans. However, the two brothers have differing agendas: while Spartacus wants to return with his wife, Senona and son to his beloved Thrace and his live as a shepherd, Phasarius wants to sack Rome. He declares, \"Whilst this city stands, This ne\\'er can be; for just so long our country Remains a Roman province. Tear it down, And you enfranchise Thrace, and half the world\". Phasarius eventually defects from his brother\\'s army when Spartacus forbids his advance on Julia, the captured niece of Crassus, a Roman praetor. Splintered, the various rebelling armies are easily defeated by the Romans. Phasarius, reconciled and reunited with his brother\\'s dwindling campaign, attempts to escort Senona and her son through a forest to safety. In this attempt, Senona and her child are slain by waiting Roman troops, while Phasarius manages to stumble back to Spartacus and deliver the tragic news before he too dies. Enraged, Spartacus refuses a pardon granted to him by the Romans. In his final bloody fight, Spartacus manages to kill his former captor, Lentulus, before he is felled by multiple Roman troops over the cries of Julia\\'s protest. Though it does not have happy ending, \"The Gladiator\" conveys the huge sacrifice man has been willing to withstand throughout history for the sake of freedom. Production history. \"The Gladiator\" premiered at New York\\'s Park Theatre on September 26, 1831. Although the weather on opening night was poor, the actors in secondary roles of questionable distinction and the sets and costumes \"wretchedly bad,\" the play was a massive success and was received with increasing enthusiasm each of the four nights it played. This original production was noted for the play\\'s climatic Act Two in which Spartacus and Pharsarius refuse to slaughter each other. This scene was staged in a spectacular way, the likes of which had not yet been seen that century. After such success in New York, the production moved to Philadelphia, where it was first produced on October 24 and Boston, where the play was seen in November. \"The Gladiator\" was such a success for Forrest that he opened with it when he traveled to London in 1836. Although Forrest was a success at the Drury Lane Theatre on October 17 with \"The Gladiator\", the audience demonstrated their desire to see Shakespeare as \"The Gladiator\" was seen by many in the audience as anti-British. Although \"The Gladiator\" remained a central part of Forrest\\'s repertoire, as with many pre-Civil War plays, it eventually fell out of favor as naturalism and \"realistic representation\" became more popular. Even though Bird\\'s work helped secure Forrest prominence, their partnership ended when Forrest failed to compensate Bird as they had originally agreed. In fact, Forrest\\'s \"poor treatment led Bird to become a novelist\". Notwithstanding the dissolution of their partnership, Forrest produced and starred in \"The Gladiator\" over 1000 times. Slavery in \"The Gladiator\". The social relevance of \"The Gladiator\" is unquestionable. Spartacus is the \"underdog who through thirst for individual freedom and love of family risks all in taking on a tyrannical government\". Certainly, 19th century American theater patrons could identify to this as the young country was still figuring out how to live up to the \"promises of the Revolution\". But the impact reached far beyond the confines of mainstream American theater goers. Dealing with slave insurgency in Ancient Rome, \"The Gladiator\" implicitly attacks the institution of Slavery in the United States by \"transforming the Antebellum into neoclassical rebels\". Spartacus was born free just like the first generation of slaves in America and he valued that freedom above anything but family. Unquestionably, the play deals with many of the issues faced by the African slaves of the time including the inevitable shattering of family units resulting from individual slave sales. Spartacus\\' yearning for his wife and son mirrored the plight of many slaves with family members scattered across multiple households or plantations. Although Spartacus finds himself \"removed from anything like liberty and dignity\", he manages to rise from the \"lowest of the low to become an inspiring role model who comes close to achieving freedom for himself and others\". Bird\\'s opinion on Slavery in the United States is often questioned in regards to \"The Gladiator\". The play was written in a time of great abolitionist activity: William Lloyd Garrison founded The Liberator, an influential anti-slavery newspaper, the same year as Bird wrote his play. Thus the timing of the first performance of \"The Gladiator\" was impeccable with it coinciding with the inception of The Liberator. It almost seemed to predict the slave uprising led by Nat Turner in Virginia which resulted in the deaths of many whites until Turner and his men were captured and executed. In his appraisal of the work, Whitman insists that, \"this play is as full of \\'Abolitionism\\' as an egg is of meat.\" He called \"The Gladiator\" a calculated play to \"make the heart of the masses well responsive to all those noble aspirations on behalf of mortal freedom\". Clearly, Whitman had no doubt of the play\\'s abolitionist undertones. Jenna Gibbs states that Bird \"used the story to denounce black slavery\" and adds that, \"Bird noted that his intention was an impassionate and strong dialogue about slavery\". Richards was also convinced of Bird\\'s anti-slavery agenda stating, \"\"The Gladiator\" seems intent in reminding audiences that it enacts a slave revolt\". Yet later scholars have dissented from Whitman\\'s surety. Though some still debate that it is not clear that he intentionally conceived \"The Gladiator\" as an abolitionist play, everyone agrees that he was fully aware of its incendiary potential in the South. Certainly, Bird did not want his play to be \"damned\" in the south. And while Bird himself was worried that, \"The Gladiator\" produced in a Slave state would lead to, \"the managers, players, and perhaps myself ... rewarded with the Penitentiary,\" he also differentiated between \"nobel\" Thracian rebels and \"violent\" African American slaves. Writing in his journal of the Nat Turner slave rebellion, Bird remarks, \"if they had had a Spartacus among them to organize the half million of Virginia, the hundreds of thousands of the [other] states, and lead them on in the Crusade of Massacre, what a blessed example might they not give the world of the excellence of slavery.\" Regardless of Bird\\'s intention, the truth is that the play\\'s setting could be easily changed from Rome to a Southern plantation without need to modify much else. Criticism. From the very first performance in New York City the play was a major success, both commercially and critically. Mr. Forrest\\'s Spartacus was deemed \"the perfection of the art histrionic\" and \"one of the gems that shone upon the stage\". Amongst other praise accorded \"The Gladiator\", it was called \"the best native tragedy extant,\" \"decidedly the best drama ever written in this century\" with \"the stamp of genius in every lineament.\" The prominent Philadelphia critic, Wemyss called the play, upon its opening in that city, \"the perfection of melodramatic tragedy.\" The play was indeed a huge success in Philadelphia as well as Boston and other cities in the Northeastern United States. Writing in \"The Brooklyn Eagle\" in late 1846, Walt Whitman also discusses Forrest\\'s talent, citing the actor as \"a deserved favorite with the public.\" While the relationship between \"The Gladiator\" and its playwright to slavery is much debated (see above), the play is often seen as the pinnacle of romanticism in American drama. Written only a few years following the inauguration of Andrew Jackson, the play is Anti-imperial and anti-British where distant colonies are persecuted while ancient lineages reign dominant over \"the new blood of the poor,\" a common theme in Jacksonian political rhetoric. \"The Gladiator\" played successfully across the country for 70 years. A marker of its enormous success may be seen in how many performances were produced: by 1854, \"The Gladiator\" had been performed over 1000 times, a remarkable feat. It was considered to be the first time a play had reached such a threshold in the playwright\\'s lifetime. Forrest retained the play in his repertoire until his death, and it was eventually taken up by John Edward McCullough and Robert Downing. Legacy. \"The Gladiator\"\\'s legacy was a success from its very first performance. Its theatrical acclaim can be attributed to the appeal of its star, Edwin Forrest, in conjunction with the story of the oppressed seeking freedom from despotism. The story not only capitalized on the success of the American Revolution but it fed from the cultural and societal mood of the time. By subtly tying the story of Roman slavery to that of African American slaves, Bird created a framework through which he could express his human equality views. As a result, \"The Gladiator\" became a cornerstone of American dramaturgy awarding Bird his righteous place as one of the most acclaimed playwrights of the early 19th century. Having been performed over 1000 times, \"The Gladiator\"\\'s longevity attests to the universality of its central story touching on themes ranging from freedom and family to the sacrifice sometimes required to achieve societal rather than individual goals. Not only is the story of \"The Gladiator\" a universally appealing tale, but Forrest\\'s foresight in having such a play custom fitted to his ability is also an important aspect of the legacy of this work. In fact, \"The Gladiator\\'\"s \"Spartacus was perfectly conceived to meet the actor\\'s strengths\" and completely suited to \"Forrest\\'s Roman figure and actions\". Spartacus is \"loud, dynamic, and anti-aristocratic\" which perfectly suited Forrest\\'s image. With Forrest talents and physical abilities determining the course of the play, it is one of the first instances where a particular actor\\'s skills and physique dictate the tone and content of a theatrical offering. Today, theatrical vehicles are often created to fit the needs and desires of many superstars and even up- and comers who are believed to be worth the time and financial investment. Published during the \"Golden Era of the American Stage\", \"The Gladiator\" stands as one of the first epics written by an American author. As a theatrical piece, its impact in the American entertainment industry is irrefutable. Bird\\'s play, with its critical and financial success, demonstrated the potential of ancient history as fodder for entertainment. It can be considered a precursor to the many works inspired or set during the Roman Empire that are found in contemporary literature and portrayed in the theatre, television shows, and feature films. For example, Broadway\\'s Her First Roman and Pippin are based on Roman Empire characters though gladiators are not central to the stories. Gladiators do abound in television and film. Spartacus\\' story has been told by at least one long running television series and a 2004 made-for-TV movie starring Goran Visnjic. On the big screen, Howard Fast\\'s novel Spartacus was adapted into film in 1960 starring Kirk Douglas and it is considered a classic. Just like Bird\\'s play, Fast\\'s novel has social relevance in that it reflects the fight for the \"political empowerment of the working class\" (Joshel et al. 91). Perhaps the most successful Roman Empire movie is the 2000 film Gladiator starring Russell Crowe. Though not directly based on Bird\\'s work, the influence of \"The Gladiator\" is evident throughout Crowe\\'s film. Although the story is different, the heroic central figure, Maximus, is uncannily similar to Spartacus including the yearning for family, his failed attempt at escaping Roman rule, and his untimely sacrificial death. It is important to note that, just like Forrest, the actors in both of the films mentioned had input regarding the content of the films and used them as career building vehicles.',\n",
       " 'Jane Jin Kaisen (born May 28, 1980) is a visual artist and filmmaker based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Biography. Kaisen was born in Jeju Island, South Korea and adopted to Denmark in 1980. She is Professor of Media Arts at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. She received her Ph.D. from University of Copenhagen, her MA in Media Art and Art Theory from The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and an MFA in Interdisciplinary Studio Art from The University of California Los Angeles. She also participated in The Whitney Independent Study Program. Working with video installation, experimental film, photographic installation, performance, and text, Kaisen\\'s artistic practice is informed by extensive interdisciplinary research and engagement with diverse communities. She is known for her visually striking, multilayered, performative, poetic, and multi-voiced feminist works through which past and present are brought into relation. Engaging topics such as memory, migration, borders, and translation, she activates the field where subjective experience and embodied knowledge intersect with larger political histories. Her works negotiate and mediate the means of representation, resistance and reconciliation, thus forming alternative genealogies and sites of collective emergence. She represented Korea at the 58th Venice Biennale with the film installation Community of Parting (2019) alongside artists Hwayeon Nam and siren eun young jeong in the exhibition History Has Failed Us, but No Matter curated by Hyunjin Kim. Her narrative experimental film \"The Woman, The Orphan, and The Tiger\" (2010) made in collaboration with Guston Sondin-Kung explores the gendered effects of war and militarism by tracing a genealogy between three generations of women. In 2011 Jane Jin Kaisen began the multi-channel video installation \"Reiterations of Dissent\" for which she was awarded the Montana ENTERPRIZE. The piece has been exhibited widely and in multiple formats, among others at Asia Culture Center (KR), Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art (KR), Aarhus Kunstbygning (DK), Kunsthallen Brandts (DK), Sonoma County Museum (USA), and The Jeju April 3 Peace Park (KR). Jane Jin Kaisen is the co-founder of the artist unit itinerant with Guston Sondin Kung and together they have organized and curated a series of art exhibitions and events. She is also co-founder of the artist groups UFOlab (Unidentified Foreign Object Laboratory) with Anna Jin Hwa Borstam, Charlotte Kim Boed, Jette Hye Jin Mortensen and Trine Meesook Gleerup) as well as the artist group Orientity along with Natsue Haji OH, Kimura byol-nathalie lemoine, Adel KsK, Raymond Hahn, Naomi K.

       " \"The 100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics has been contested by both men and women since the inaugural edition in 1983. It is the second most prestigious 100\\xa0m title after the 100 metres at the Olympics. The competition format typically has two or three qualifying rounds leading to a final between eight athletes. Since 2011 a preliminary round has been held, where athletes who have not achieved the qualifying standard time compete to enter the first round proper. The championship records for the event are 9.58 seconds for men, set by Usain Bolt in 2009, and 10.67 seconds for women, set by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce in 2022. The men's world record has been broken or equalled at the competition three times: by Carl Lewis in 1987 and 1991, and by Usain Bolt in 2009. Ben Johnson beat Lewis in the 1987 final, but his win and record were subsequently rescinded after his admission to long-term steroid use. Lewis's mark, which equalled the standing record at the time, was never officially ratified by the IAAF as a world record. The women's world record has not yet been beaten at the championships. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is the most successful athlete of the event as the only person, male or female to win five titles. Carl Lewis, Maurice Greene and Usain Bolt are the most successful male athletes of the event, having each won three titles. Justin Gatlin ties Fraser-Pryce the most medals with 5, 2 gold and 3 silver. Merlene Ottey and Carmelita Jeter are the only other athletes to have claimed four medals in the history of the World Championships event. The United States is the most successful nation in the discipline, having won fifteen gold medals. Jamaica are a clear second with six gold medals. East Germany, with two, is the only other nation to have won multiple titles. Doping. Canada's Ben Johnson and Angella Taylor-Issajenko were both disqualified from the 1987 World Championships in Athletics for doping. Johnson was stripped of his 100\\xa0m gold, elevating Carl Lewis to world champion, while Taylor-Issajenko finished fifth in the women's 100\\xa0m final. At the following edition in 1991, Irina Slyusar of the Soviet Union (a women's semi-finalist) was disqualified for doping. Eight years passed without incident in the 100\\xa0m before the double Nigerian doping disqualification of Innocent Asonze and Davidson Ezinwa in 1999. Tim Montgomery became the 100\\xa0m second medalist to be disqualified, losing his silver medal from the 2001 World Championships in Athletics. From the same event, Marion Jones later lost her silver medal for doping infractions, becoming the first female medalist to be stripped of a 100\\xa0m medal. Venolyn Clarke and Kelli White (a women's finalist) were also disqualified that year. The results of Dwain Chambers and Montgomery, fourth and fifth in 2003, were removed for doping. Two women's medalists were stripped of their honours for doping Kelli White lost the world title while Zhanna Block had her bronze medal removed. Block's times from the 2005 edition were also annulled. These disqualifications were a result of the BALCO scandal, which included many 100\\xa0m runners. No doping offences were recorded at the 2007 World Championships 100 metres, but bans shortly returned, with Ruqaya Al-Ghasra being banned from the 2009 edition and a female trio of Inna Eftimova, Semoy Hackett and Norjannah Hafiszah Jamaludin being disqualified in 2011. The 2013 World Championships saw one elimination in Masoud Azizi. Among the men's world champions, only Donovan Bailey and Usain Bolt have not been implicated in doping during their careers; three-time champion Maurice Greene never failed a drug test, but admitted purchasing drugs on other athletes behalf.

       " 'Brian Gregory Keating (born September 9, 1971) is an American cosmologist. He works on observations of the cosmic microwave background, leading the BICEP, POLARBEAR2 and Simons Array experiments. He received his PhD in 2000, and is a distinguished professor of physics at University of California, San Diego, since 2019. He is the author of two books, \"Losing The Nobel Prize\" and \"Into the Impossible\". Personal life. Brian was born on September 9, 1971. His father is the mathematician James Ax, and his mother is named Barbara. After Ax and Barbara divorced when Brian was about seven, Barbara remarried a man named Keating, and Brian took his stepfather\\'s name. Brian was out of contact with his father for the next 15 years, reconnecting when Brian was a graduate student. Brian has a brother, Kevin, who is three years older. He grew up in Dobbs Ferry, New York. As a youth, Keating was a member of the Catholic Church. He later became an atheist, and subsequently he became Jewish, describing himself as a \\'practicing devout agnostic\\'. As well as a cosmologist, he is a pilot with a multi-engine turbine license. He was a trustee of Math for America, San Diego in 2006–2014, Angel Flight West in 2010–2015, and the National Museum of Mathematics in 2014–2017. He is currently a trustee of San Diego Air & Space Museum since 2013, and is on the Ruben H. Fleet Museum advisory council since 2017. Education and career. Keating received his B.S. degree in Physics from the Case Western Reserve University in 1993. He then obtained his M.S. degree in Physics from Brown University in 1995, and subsequently studied for his Ph.D. also at Brown. His thesis, titled \"A search for the large angular scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background\" and supervised by Peter Timbie, was accepted in 2000. He started as a National Science Foundation (NSF) postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology in 2001 until 2004. He was an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego from 2004, before being promoted to associate professor there in 2009. He received an NSF career grant in 2005, and a Presidential Early Career Award in 2006. Keating was one of three scientists, along with Jonathan Kaufman and Bradley Johnson, to receive the Buchalter Cosmology Prize in 2014. He became co-director of the Ax Center for Experimental Cosmology and the Joan & Irwin Jacobs Program in Astrophysics in 2013. Keating became a professor at UC San Diego in 2014. He became a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2016. In 2019 he became the Chancellor\\'s Distinguished Professor of Physics at UC San Diego, in the Center for Astrophysics & Space Sciences, which is part of the Department of Physics. Keating received an Excellence in Stewardship Award in 2018-2019, and is an honorary member of the National Society of Black Physicists. He is co-director of the Arthur C. Clarke Center for the Human Imagination at UC San Diego. He received the Horace Mann Medal from Brown University Graduate School in 2022. Research. Keating researches cosmology, focusing on the study of the cosmic microwave background and its relationship to the origin and evolution of the universe. He conceived the BICEP (Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization) instrument, which observed from the South Pole. BICEP received a NASA Group Achievement Award in 2010. In 2016 he convinced the Simons Foundation to provide US$38.4m of funding for what later became the Simons Array, and in 2019 a US$20m grant from the Simons Foundation led to the creation of the Simons Observatory, followed by an additional US$4.6m in 2021. Keating co-leads POLARBEAR2 and the Simons Array in Chile, and has raised around US$100m of funding for CMB telescopes. He has two patents, on a \"wide-bandwidth polarization modulator for microwave and mm-wavelengths\" in 2009, and \"Tunnel junction fabrication\" in 2016. Podcast and outreach. Keating has hosted the Clarke Center \"Into the Impossible\" podcast since 2016. It takes its name from the second of Clarke\\'s three laws: \"The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them \"into the impossible\".\" Each episode is a long-form conversation with nobel laureates, scientists, writers and other notable individuals such as Noam Chomsky, Eric Weinstein, Jill Tarter, Sara Seager, and nobel prize winners interviewed for his books, lasting around an hour. it has around 50,000 subscribers, and has hosted 11 Nobel Prize winners and two recipients of the Pulitzer Prize. Keating also appeared in the Michael Shermer Show podcast in 2019, and the Lex Fridman Podcast in 2022. He has also recorded videos for PragerU, and has talked about popular science connected with The Witcher television series. He appeared in the \"Mysteries Of The Moon\" episode of The UnXplained. He also teaches astronomy to high school students since 2012 as part of his outreach work, and has given presentations to over 3,000 K-12 students since 1994. He has also co-narrated a 21-hour audio book of Galileo Galilei\\'s \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\" in 2022. Books about the Nobel Prize. Keating is critical of the way that Nobel Prizes are organized, saying that \"No scientist arrives alone in Stockholm.\" He has written two books on the topic. The Nobel Prize was a motivating factor in Keating\\'s career due to his academic rivalry with his father. \"Losing The Nobel Prize\" (2018). Keating published his first book \"Losing the Nobel Prize: A Story of Cosmology, Ambition, and the Perils of Science\\'s Highest Honor\" on April 24, 2018. The book describes the BICEP and BICEP2 experiments, which were located at the South Pole and were devised to detect and map the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation leftover from the Big Bang. BICEP2\\'s data showed strong polarization signals that were announced to be cosmological in origin, but were later shown by Planck satellite data to be caused by polarized interstellar dust. The first part of the book describes the background behind cosmological inflation, and the second covers BICEP2. The third section focuses on Keating\\'s issues with the Nobel Prize, including lack of diversity in the recipients, that the prize can\\'t be awarded posthumously, the maximum of three laureates per prize, which excludes larger groups from receiving it, and the secrecy around nominations. According to Keating, all of these \"reward an outdated version of science\", and \"better science comes from inclusivity, collaboration, and innovation\". He argues that the science Nobel Prizes have strayed from the original intent of Alfred Nobel\\'s will, and may hinder scientific progress by fostering unnecessary, and sometimes destructive, competition. He proposed that half a Nobel prize should go to the leaders of a collaboration, with the other half awarded to the rest of the team of scientists working on the project. \"Into the Impossible\" (2021). His second book, \"Into the Impossible\", was published in 2021. It features interviews with Nobel Prize winners Adam Riess, Rainer Weiss, Sheldon Glashow, Carl Wieman, Roger Penrose, Duncan Haldane, Frank Wilczek, John C. Mather and Barry Barish.',\n",

They originally intended to also work as independent research institutes in their field, but this role is now of less importance. The opportunity for the prize-awarding institutions to set up the Nobel Institutes was included in the Nobel Foundation original foundation statutes. The establishment of such institutions was however not written in the will of Alfred Nobel. Å.G. Ekstrand meant that the idea probably came from the chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson.',\n",
       " 'This article is focused on English-language literature rather than the literature of England, so that it includes writers from Scotland, Wales, and the whole of Ireland, as well as literature in English from former British colonies. It also includes, to some extent, the United States, though the main article for that is American literature. Modernism is a major literary movement of the first part of the twentieth-century. The term Postmodern literature is used to describe certain tendencies in post-World War II literature. Irish writers were especially important in the twentieth-century, including James Joyce and later Samuel Beckett, both central figures in the Modernist movement. Americans, like poets T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound and novelist William Faulkner, were other important modernists. British modernists include Joseph Conrad, E. M. Forster, Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf, and D. H. Lawrence. In the mid-twentieth-century major writers started to appear in the various countries of the British Commonwealth, including several Nobel laureates. 1901-1922 modernism. In the early 20th-century literary modernism developed in the English-speaking world due to a general sense of disillusionment with the Victorian era attitudes of certainty, conservatism, and belief in the idea of objective truth. The movement was influenced by the ideas of Charles Darwin (1809-1882) (\"On Origin of Species\") (1859), Ernst Mach (1838–1916), Henri Bergson (1859–1941), Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), James G. Frazer (1854–1941), Karl Marx (1818-1883) (\"Das Kapital\", 1867), and the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), among others. The continental art movements of Impressionism, and later Cubism, were also important inspirations for modernist writers. Important literary precursors of modernism, were: Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-1881) (\"Crime and Punishment\" (1866), \"The Brothers Karamazov\" (1880); Walt Whitman (1819-1892) (\"Leaves of Grass\") (1855-1891); Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867) (\"Les Fleurs du mal\"), Rimbaud (1854-1891) (\"Illuminations\", 1874); August Strindberg (1849–1912), especially his later plays. A major British lyric poet of the first decades of the 20th century was Thomas Hardy (1840–1928). Though not a modernist, Hardy was an important transitional figure between the Victorian era and the 20th century. A major novelist of the late 19th century, Hardy, after the adverse criticism of his last novel, \"Jude the Obscure\", concentrated on publishing poetry. On the other hand, another significant transitional figure between Victorians and modernists, the late-19th-century novelist, Henry James (1843–1916), continued to publish major works into the 20th century. James, born in the US, lived in Europe from 1875, and became a British citizen in 1915. Another immigrant, Polish-born modernist novelist Joseph Conrad (1857–1924) published his first important work, \"Heart of Darkness\", in 1899 and \"Lord Jim\" in 1900. The American exponent of Naturalism Theodore Dreiser\\'s (1871–1945) \"Sister Carrie\" was also published in 1900. Poetry. However, the Victorian Gerard Manley Hopkins\\'s (1844-1889) highly original poetry was not published until 1918, long after his death, while the career of another major modernist poet, Irishman W. B. Yeats (1865–1939), began late in the Victorian era. Yeats was one of the foremost figures of 20th-century literature. A pillar of both the Irish and British literary establishments, in his later years he served as an Irish Senator for two terms. Yeats was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival. In 1923 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first Irishman so honoured. Yeats is generally considered one of the few writers who completed their greatest works after being awarded the Nobel Prize: these works include \"The Tower\" (1928) and \"The Winding Stair and Other Poems\" (1929). In addition to W. B. Yeats other important early modernist poets were the American poets T. S. Eliot (1888–1965) and Ezra Pound (1885–1972). Eliot became a British citizen in 1927 but was born and educated in America. His most famous works are: \"Prufrock\" (1915), \"The Waste Land\" (1921) and \"Four Quartets\" (1935-1942). Ezra Pound was not only a major poet, first publishing part of \"The Cantos\" in 1917, but an important mentor for other poets, most significantly in his editorial advice for Eliot\\'s poem \"The Waste Land\". Other important American poets writing early in the 20th century were William Carlos Williams (1883–1963), Robert Frost (1874–1963), who published his first collection in England in 1913, and H.D. (1886–1961). Gertrude Stein (1874–1946), an American expatriate living in Paris, famous for her line \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose,\" was also an important literary force during this time period. American poet Marianne Moore (1887–1972) published from the 1920s to the 1960s. But while modernism was to become an important literary movement in the early decades of the new century, there were also many fine writers who, like Thomas Hardy, were not modernists. During the early decades of the 20th century the Georgian poets like Rupert Brooke (1887–1915), Walter de la Mare (1873–1956), and John Masefield (1878–1967, Poet Laureate from 1930) maintained a conservative approach to poetry by combining romanticism, sentimentality and hedonism, sandwiched as they were between the Victorian era, with its strict classicism, and Modernism, with its strident rejection of pure aestheticism. Edward Thomas (1878–1917) is sometimes treated as another Georgian poet. Thomas enlisted in 1915 and is one of the First World War poets along with Wilfred Owen (1893–1918), Rupert Brooke (1887–1915), Isaac Rosenberg (1890–1917), Edmund Blunden (1896–1974) and Siegfried Sassoon (1886–1967). Drama. Irish playwrights George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950) and J.M. Synge (1871–1909) were influential in British drama. Shaw\\'s career began in the last decade of the 19th century, while Synge\\'s plays belong to the first decade of the 20th century. Synge\\'s most famous play, \"The Playboy of the Western World\", \"caused outrage and riots when it was first performed\" in Dublin in 1907. George Bernard Shaw turned the Edwardian theatre into an arena for debate about important political and social issues, like marriage, class, \"the morality of armaments and war\" and the rights of women. An important dramatist in the 1920s, and later, was Irishman Seán O\\'Casey (1880–1964). Also in the 1920s and later Noël Coward (1899–1973) achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as \"Hay Fever\" (1925), \"Private Lives\" (1930), \"Design for Living\" (1932), \"Present Laughter\" (1942) and \"Blithe Spirit\" (1941), have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. Novelists. Amongst the novelists, after Joseph Conrad, other important early modernists include Dorothy Richardson (1873–1957), whose novel \"Pointed Roof\" (1915), is one of the earliest example of the stream of consciousness technique, and D. H. Lawrence (1885–1930), who published \"The Rainbow\" in 1915, though it was immediately seized by the police. Then in 1922 Irishman James Joyce\\'s important modernist novel \"Ulysses\" appeared. \"Ulysses\" has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement\". Set during one day in Dublin, in it Joyce creates parallels with Homer\\'s epic poem the Odyssey. William Faulkner\\'s \"The Sound and the Fury\" (1929) is another significant modernist novel, that uses the stream of consciousness technique. Novelists who are not considered modernists include: Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936) who was also a successful poet; H. G. Wells (1866–1946); John Galsworthy (1867–1933), (Nobel Prize in Literature, 1932) whose works include a sequence of novels, collectively called \"The Forsyte Saga\" (1906-1921); Arnold Bennett (1867–1931) author of \"The Old Wives\\' Tale\" (1908); G. K. Chesterton (1874–1936); and E.M. Forster\\'s (1879–1970), though Forster\\'s work is \"frequently regarded as containing both modernist and Victorian elements\". H. G. Wells was a prolific author who is now best known for his science fiction novels, most notably \"The War of the Worlds\", \"The Time Machine\", \"The Invisible Man\" and \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\" all written in the 1890s. Other novels include \"Kipps\" (1905) and \"Mr Polly\" (1910). Forster\\'s most famous work, \"A Passage to India\" 1924, reflected challenges to imperialism, while his earlier novels, such as \"A Room with a View\" (1908) and \"Howards End\" (1910), examined the restrictions and hypocrisy of Edwardian society in England. Another major work of science fiction, from the early 20th century, is \"A Voyage to Arcturus\" by Scottish writer David Lindsay, first published in 1920. It combines fantasy, philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. It has been described by writer Colin Wilson as the \"greatest novel of the twentieth century\", and was a central influence on C. S. Lewis\\'s \"Space Trilogy\". The most popular British writer of the early years of the 20th century was arguably Rudyard Kipling, a highly versatile writer of novels, short stories and poems, and to date the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature (1907). Kipling\\'s works include \"The Jungle Books\" (1894-1895), \"The Man Who Would Be King\" and \"Kim\" (1901), while his inspirational poem \"If—\" (1895) is a national favourite and a memorable evocation of Victorian stoicism. Kipling\\'s reputation declined during his lifetime, but more recently postcolonial studies has \"rekindled an intense interest in his work, viewing it as both symptomatic and critical of imperialist attitudes\". Strongly influenced by his Christian faith, G. K. Chesterton was a prolific and hugely influential writer with a diverse output. His best-known character is the priest-detective Father Brown, who appeared only in short stories, while \"The Man Who Was Thursday\" published in 1908 is arguably his best-known novel. Of his nonfiction, \"Charles Dickens: A Critical Study\" (1906) was largely responsible for creating a popular revival for Dickens\\'s work as well as a serious reconsideration of Dickens by scholars. Modernism in the 1920s and 1930s. The modernist movement continued through the 1920s and 1930s and beyond. During the period between the World Wars, American drama came to maturity, thanks in large part to the works of Eugene O\\'Neill (1888–1953). O\\'Neill\\'s experiments with theatrical form and his use of both Naturalist and Expressionist techniques had a major influence on American dramatists. His best-known plays include \"Anna Christie\" (Pulitzer Prize 1922), \"Desire Under the Elms\" (1924), \"Strange Interlude\" (Pulitzer Prize 1928), \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" (1931). In poetry Hart Crane published \"The Bridge\" in 1930 and E. E. Cummings and Wallace Stevens were publishing from the 1920s until the 1950s. Similarly William Faulkner continued to publish until the 1950s and was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1949. However, not all those writing in these years were modernists; among the writers outside the movement were American novelists Theodore Dreiser, Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald (\"The Great Gatsby\" 1925), and John Steinbeck. Important British writers between the World Wars, include the Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid (1892–1978), who began publishing in the 1920s, and novelists Virginia Woolf (1882–1941), E. M. Forster (1879–1970) (\"A Passage to India\", 1924), Evelyn Waugh (1903–1966), Graham Greene (1904–1991), Anthony Powell (1905–2000), P. G. Wodehouse (1881–1975) (who was not a modernist) and D. H. Lawrence. Lawrence\\'s \"Lady Chatterley\\'s Lover\" was published privately in Florence in 1928, though the unexpurgated version was not published in Britain until 1959. Woolf was an influential feminist, and a major stylistic innovator associated with the stream-of-consciousness technique in novels like \"Mrs Dalloway\" (1925) and \"To the Lighthouse\" (1927). Her 1929 essay \"A Room of One\\'s Own\" contains her famous dictum \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\". In the 1930s W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood co-authored verse dramas, of which The Ascent of F6 (1936) is the most notable, that owed much to Bertolt Brecht. T. S. Eliot had begun this attempt to revive poetic drama with \"Sweeney Agonistes\" in 1932, and this was followed by \"The Rock\" (1934), \"Murder in the Cathedral\" (1935) and \"Family Reunion\" (1939). There were three further plays after the war. \"In Parenthesis\", a modernist epic poem by David Jones (1895–1974) first published in 1937, is probably the best known contribution from Wales to the literature of the First World War. An important development, beginning in the 1930s and 1940s was a tradition of working class novels actually written by working-class background writers. Among these were coal miner Jack Jones, James Hanley, whose father was a stoker and who also went to sea as a young man, and coal miners Lewis Jones from South Wales and Harold Heslop from County Durham. Aldous Huxley (1894–1963) published his famous dystopia \"Brave New World\" in 1932, the same year as John Cowper Powys\\'s \"A Glastonbury Romance\". Henry Miller\\'s \"Tropic of Cancer\" then appeared in 1934, though it was banned for many years in both Britain and America. Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) published his first major work, the novel \"Murphy\" in 1938. This same year Graham Greene\\'s (1904-1991) first major novel \"Brighton Rock\" was published. Then in 1939 James Joyce\\'s published \"Finnegans Wake\", in which he creates a special language to express the consciousness of a dreaming character. It was also in 1939 that another Irish modernist poet, W. B. Yeats, died. British poet W. H. Auden was another significant modernist in the 1930s. 1940 to 2000. Though some have seen modernism ending by around 1939, with regard to English literature, \"When (if) modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to modernism occurred\". In fact a number of modernists were still living and publishing in the 1950s and 1960, including T. S. Eliot, William Faulkner, Dorothy Richardson, and Ezra Pound. Furthermore, Basil Bunting (1900–1985) published little until \"Briggflatts\" in 1965 and Samuel Beckett, born in Ireland in 1906, continued to produce significant works until the 1980s, including \"Waiting for Godot\" (1953), \"Happy Days\" (1961), \"Rockaby\" (1981), though some view him as a post-modernist. Among British writers in the 1940s and 1950s were novelists Graham Greene and Anthony Powell, whose works span the 1930s to the 1980s and poet Dylan Thomas, while Evelyn Waugh, and W. H. Auden continued publishing significant work. The novel. In 1947 Malcolm Lowry published \"Under the Volcano\", while George Orwell\\'s dystopia of totalitarianism, \"1984\", was published in 1949. One of the most influential novels of the immediate post-war period was William Cooper\\'s naturalistic \"Scenes from Provincial Life\", a conscious rejection of the modernist tradition. Graham Greene was a convert to Catholicism and his novels explore the ambivalent moral and political issues of the modern world. Notable for an ability to combine serious literary acclaim with broad popularity, his novels include \"Brighton Rock\" (1938), \"The Power and the Glory\" (1940), \"The Heart of the Matter\" (1948), \"A Burnt-Out Case\" (1961), and \"The Human Factor\" (1978). Other novelists writing in the 1950s and later were: Anthony Powell whose twelve-volume cycle of novels \"A Dance to the Music of Time\", is a comic examination of movements and manners, power and passivity in English political, cultural and military life in the mid-20th century; comic novelist Kingsley Amis (1922–1995) is best known for his academic satire \"Lucky Jim\" (1954); Nobel Prize laureate William Golding\\'s allegorical novel \"Lord of the Flies\" 1954, explores how culture created by man fails, using as an example a group of British schoolboys marooned on a deserted island who try to govern themselves, but with disastrous results. Philosopher Iris Murdoch was a prolific writer of novels throughout the second half of the 20th century, that deal especially with sexual relationships, morality, and the power of the unconscious, including \"Under the Net\" (1954), \"The Black Prince\" (1973) and \"The Green Knight\" (1993). Scottish writer Muriel Spark pushed the boundaries of realism in her novels. Her first, \"The Comforters\" (1957) concerns a woman who becomes aware that she is a character in a novel; \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" (1961), at times takes the reader briefly into the distant future, to see the various fates that befall its characters. Anthony Burgess is especially remembered for his dystopian novel \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1962), set in the not-too-distant future, which was made into a film by Stanley Kubrick in 1971. In the entirely different genre of Gothic fantasy Mervyn Peake (1911–1968) published his highly successful Gormenghast trilogy between 1946 and 1959. One of Penguin Books\\' most successful publications in the 1970s was Richard Adams\\'s heroic fantasy \"Watership Down\" (1972). Evoking epic themes, it recounts the odyssey of a group of rabbits seeking to establish a new home. Another successful novel of the same era was John Fowles\\' \"The French Lieutenant\\'s Woman\" (1969), with a narrator who freely admits the fictive nature of his story, and its famous alternative endings. This was made into a film in 1981 with a screenplay by Harold Pinter. Angela Carter (1940–1992) was a novelist and journalist, known for her feminist, magical realism, and picaresque works. Her novels include, \"The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman\" 1972 and \"Nights at the Circus\" 1984. Margaret Drabble (born 1939) is a novelist, biographer and critic, who published from the 1960s into the 21st century. Her older sister, A. S. Byatt (born 1936) is best known for \"Possession\" published in 1990. Martin Amis (born 1949) is one of the most prominent of contemporary British novelists. His best-known novels are \"Money\" (1984) and \"London Fields\" (1989). Pat Barker (born 1943) has won many awards for her fiction. English novelist and screenwriter Ian McEwan (born 1948) is another of contemporary Britain\\'s most highly regarded writers. His works include \"The Cement Garden\" (1978) and \"Enduring Love\" (1997), which was made into a film. In 1998 McEwan won the Man Booker Prize with \"Amsterdam\". \"Atonement\" (2001) was made into an Oscar-winning film. McEwan was awarded the Jerusalem Prize in 2011. Zadie Smith\\'s Whitbread Book Award winning novel \"White Teeth\" (2000), mixes pathos and humour, focusing on the later lives of two war time friends in London. Julian Barnes (born 1946) is another successful living novelist, who won the 2011 Man Booker Prize for his book \"The Sense of an Ending\", while three of his earlier books were shortlisted for the Booker Prize: \"Flaubert\\'s Parrot\" (1984), \"England, England\" (1998), and \"Arthur & George\" (2005). He has also written crime fiction under the pseudonym Dan Kavanagh. Two significant contemporary Irish novelists are John Banville (born 1945) and Colm Tóibín (born 1955). Banville is also an adapter of dramas, a screenwriter, and a writer of detective novels under the pseudonym Benjamin Black. Banville has won numerous awards: \"The Book of Evidence\" was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and won the Guinness Peat Aviation award in 1989; his eighteenth novel, \"The Sea\", won the Booker Prize in 2005; he was awarded the Franz Kafka Prize in 2011. Colm Tóibín (Irish, 1955) is a novelist, short story writer, essayist, playwright, journalist, critic, and, most recently, poet. Scotland has in the late 20th century produced several important novelists, including James Kelman, who like Samuel Beckett can create humour out of the most grim situations. \"How Late it Was, How Late\", 1994, won the Booker Prize that year; A. L. Kennedy\\'s 2007 novel \"Day\" was named Book of the Year in the Costa Book Awards. In 2007 she won the Austrian State Prize for European Literature; Alasdair Gray\\'s \"\" (1981) is a dystopian fantasy set in a surreal version of Glasgow called Unthank. Drama. An important cultural movement in the British theatre which developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s was Kitchen sink realism (or \"kitchen sink drama\"), a term coined to describe art (the term itself derives from an expressionist painting by John Bratby), novels, film and television plays. The term angry young men was often applied to members of this artistic movement. It used a style of social realism which depicts the domestic lives of the working class, to explore social issues and political issues. The drawing room plays of the post war period, typical of dramatists like Terence Rattigan and Noël Coward were challenged in the 1950s by these Angry Young Men, in plays like John Osborne\\'s \"Look Back in Anger\" (1956). Arnold Wesker and Nell Dunn also brought social concerns to the stage. Again in the 1950s, the absurdist play \"Waiting for Godot\" (1955) (originally \"En attendant Godot\", 1952), by Irish writer Samuel Beckett profoundly affected British drama. The Theatre of the Absurd influenced Harold Pinter (1930–2008), author of (The Birthday Party, 1958), whose works are often characterised by menace or claustrophobia. Beckett also influenced Tom Stoppard (born 1937) (\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\", 1966). Stoppard\\'s works are however also notable for their high-spirited wit and the great range of intellectual issues which he tackles in different plays. Both Pinter and Stoppard continued to have new plays produced into the 1990s. Michael Frayn (born 1933) is among other playwrights noted for their use of language and ideas. He is also a novelist. He has written a number of novels, including, \"The Tin Men\", which won the 1966 Somerset Maugham Award), \"The Russian Interpreter\" (1967, Hawthornden Prize), and \"Spies\", which won the Whitbread Prize for Fiction in 2002. Other Important playwrights whose careers began later in the century are: Caryl Churchill (\"Top Girls\", 1982) and Alan Ayckbourn (\"Absurd Person Singular\", 1972). Radio drama. An important new element in the world of British drama, from the beginnings of radio in the 1920s, was the commissioning of plays, or the adaption of existing plays, by BBC radio. This was especially important in the 1950s and 1960s (and from the 1960s for television). Many major British playwrights in fact, either effectively began their careers with the BBC, or had works adapted for radio. Most of playwright Caryl Churchill\\'s early experiences with professional drama production were as a radio playwright and, starting in 1962 with \"The Ants\", there were nine productions with BBC radio drama up until 1973 when her stage work began to be recognised at the Royal Court Theatre. Joe Orton\\'s dramatic debut in 1963 was the radio play \"The Ruffian on the Stair\", which was broadcast on 31 August 1964. Tom Stoppard\\'s \"first professional production was in the fifteen-minute \"Just Before Midnight\" programme on BBC Radio, which showcased new dramatists\". John Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955, with his adaptation of his own novel \"Like Men Betrayed\" for the BBC Light Programme. But he made his debut as an original playwright with \"The Dock Brief\", starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Radio\\'s Third Programme, later televised with the same cast, and subsequently presented in a double bill with \"What Shall We Tell Caroline?\" at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958, before transferring to the Garrick Theatre. Mortimer is most famous for Rumpole of the Bailey a British television series which starred Leo McKern as Horace Rumpole, an aging London barrister who defends any and all clients. It has been spun off into a series of short stories, novels, and radio programmes. Other notable radio dramatists included Brendan Behan, and novelist Angela Carter. Novelist Susan Hill also wrote for BBC radio, from the early 1970s. Irish playwright Brendan Behan, author of \"The Quare Fellow\" (1954), was commissioned by the BBC to write a radio play \"The Big House\" (1956); prior to this he had written two plays \"Moving Out\"and \"A Garden Party\" for Irish radio. Among the most famous works created for radio, are Dylan Thomas\\'s \"Under Milk Wood\" (1954), Samuel Beckett\\'s \"All That Fall\" (1957), Harold Pinter\\'s \"A Slight Ache\" (1959) and Robert Bolt\\'s \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1954). Samuel Beckett wrote a number of short radio plays in the 1950s and 1960s, and later for television. Beckett\\'s radio play \"Embers\" was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 24 June 1959, and won the RAI prize at the Prix Italia awards later that year. Poetry. Major poets like T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas were still publishing in this period. Though W. H. Auden\\'s (1907–1973) career began in the 1930s and 1940s he published several volumes in the 1950s and 1960s. His stature in modern literature has been contested, but probably the most common critical view from the 1930s onward ranked him as one of the three major twentieth-century British poets, and heir to Eliot and Yeats. Stephen Spender (1909 – 1995)), whose career began in the 1930s, was another important poet. New poets starting their careers in the 1950s and 1960s include Philip Larkin (1922–1985) (\"The Whitsun Weddings\", 1964), Ted Hughes (1930–1998) (\"The Hawk in the Rain\", 1957) and Irishman (Northern Ireland) Seamus Heaney (1939–2013) (\"Death of a Naturalist\", 1966). Northern Ireland has also produced a number of other significant poets, including Derek Mahon and Paul Muldoon. In the 1960s and 1970s Martian poetry aimed to break the grip of \\'the familiar\\', by describing ordinary things in unfamiliar ways, as though, for example, through the eyes of a Martian. Poets most closely associated with it are Craig Raine and Christopher Reid. Martin Amis, an important contemporary novelist, carried this defamiliarisation into fiction. Another literary movement in this period was the British Poetry Revival, a wide-reaching collection of groupings and subgroupings which embraces performance, sound and concrete poetry. Leading poets associated with this movement include J. H. Prynne, Eric Mottram, Tom Raworth, Denise Riley and Lee Harwood. The Mersey Beat poets were Adrian Henri, Brian Patten and Roger McGough. Their work was a self-conscious attempt at creating an English equivalent to the Beats. Many of their poems were written in protest against the established social order and, particularly, the threat of nuclear war. Other noteworthy later 20th-century poets are Welshman R. S. Thomas, Geoffrey Hill, Charles Tomlinson Carol Ann Duffy (Poet Laureate from 2009 to 2019) and Simon Armitage, the current laureate. Geoffrey Hill (born 1932) is considered one of the most distinguished English poets of his generation, Although frequently described as a \"difficult\" poet, Hill has retorted that supposedly difficult poetry can be \"the most democratic because you are doing your audience the honour of supposing they are intelligent human beings\". Charles Tomlinson (1927–2015) is another important English poet of an older generation, though \"since his first publication in 1951, has built a career that has seen more notice in the international scene than in his native England; this may explain, and be explained by, his international vision of poetry\". The critic Michael Hennessy has described Tomlinson as \"the most international and least provincial English poet of his generation\". His poetry has won international recognition and has received many prizes in Europe and the United States. Writers of the British Commonwealth. Doris Lessing from Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, published her first novel \"The Grass is Singing\" in 1950, after immigrating to England. She initially wrote about her African experiences. Lessing soon became a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing right through the century, and won the nobel prize for literature in 2007. Her other works include a sequence of five novels collectively called \"Children of Violence\" (1952-1969), \"The Golden Notebook\" (1962), \"The Good Terrorist\" (1985), and a sequence of five science fiction novels the \"Canopus in Argos: Archives\" (1979-1983). Indeed, from 1950 on a significant number of major writers came from countries that had over the centuries been settled by the British, other than America which had been producing significant writers from at least the Victorian period. There had of course been a few important works in English prior to 1950 from the then British Empire. The South African writer Olive Schreiner\\'s famous novel \"The Story of an African Farm\" was published in 1883 and New Zealander Katherine Mansfield published her first collection of short stories, \"In a German Pension\", in 1911. The first major English-language novelist from the Indian sub-continent, R. K. Narayan (1906–2001), began publishing in England in the 1930s, encouraged by English novelist Graham Greene. Caribbean writer Jean Rhys\\'s writing career began as early as 1928, though her most famous work, \"Wide Sargasso Sea\", was not published until 1966. South Africa\\'s Alan Paton\\'s famous \"Cry, the Beloved Country\" dates from 1948. Salman Rushdie is among a number of post Second World War writers from the former British colonies who permanently settled in Britain. Rushdie achieved fame with \"Midnight\\'s Children\" 1981, which was awarded both the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and Booker prize, and was named Booker of Bookers in 1993. His most controversial novel \"The Satanic Verses\" 1989, was inspired in part by the life of Muhammad. V. S. Naipaul (1932–2018), born in Trinidad, was another immigrant, who wrote among other things \"A House for Mr Biswas\" (1961) and \"A Bend in the River\" (1979). Naipaul won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Also from the West Indies was George Lamming (1927–2022), who wrote \"In the Castle of My Skin\" (1953), while from Pakistan, came Hanif Kureshi (born 1954), a playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker, novelist and short story writer. His book \"The Buddha of Suburbia\" (1990) won the Whitbread Award for the best first novel, and was also made into a BBC television series. Another important immigrant writer Kazuo Ishiguro (born 1954) was born in Japan, but his parents immigrated to Britain when he was six. His works include \"The Remains of the Day\" 1989, \"Never Let Me Go\" 2005. From Nigeria a number of writers have achieved an international reputation for works in English, including novelist Chinua Achebe (1930–2013), who published \"Things Fall Apart\" in 1958, as well as playwright Wole Soyinka (born 1934) and novelist Buchi Emecheta (1944–2017). Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, as did South African novelist Nadine Gordimer in 1995. Other South African writers in English are novelist J. M. Coetzee (Nobel Prize 2003) and playwright Athol Fugard. Kenya\\'s most internationally renowned author is Ngũgĩ wa Thiong\\'o who has written novels, plays and short stories in English. Poet Derek Walcott, from St Lucia in the Caribbean, was another Nobel Prize winner in 1992. Two Irishmen and an Australian were also winners in the period after 1940: novelist and playwright, Samuel Beckett (1969); poet Seamus Heaney (1995); Patrick White (1973), a major novelist in this period, whose first work was published in 1939. Another noteworthy Australian writer at the end of this period is poet Les Murray. The contemporary Australian novelist Peter Carey (born 1943) is one of only four writers to have won the Booker Prize twice—the others being J. G. Farrell, J. M. Coetzee and Hilary Mantel. Among Canadian writers who have achieved an international reputation, are novelist and poet Margaret Atwood, poet, songwriter and novelist Leonard Cohen, short story writer Alice Munro, and more recently poet Anne Carson. Another admired Canadian novelist and poet is Michael Ondaatje, who was born in Sri Lanka. American literature. From 1940 into the 21st century, American playwrights, poets and novelists have continued to be internationally prominent. Post-modern literature. The term Postmodern literature is used to describe certain tendencies in post-World War II literature. It is both a continuation of the experimentation championed by writers of the modernist period (relying heavily, for example, on fragmentation, paradox, questionable narrators, etc.) and a reaction against Enlightenment ideas implicit in Modernist literature. Postmodern literature, like postmodernism as a whole, is difficult to define and there is little agreement on the exact characteristics, scope, and importance of postmodern literature. Among postmodern writers are the Americans Henry Miller, William S. Burroughs, Joseph Heller, Kurt Vonnegut, Hunter S. Thompson, Truman Capote and Thomas Pynchon. 20th-century genre literature. Agatha Christie (1890–1976) was a crime writer of novels, short stories and plays, who is best remembered for her 80 detective novels as well as her successful plays for the West End theatre. Christie\\'s works, particularly those featuring the detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, have given her the title \"Queen of Crime\", and she was one of the most important and innovative writers in this genre. Christie\\'s novels include \"Murder on the Orient Express\", \"Death on the Nile\" and \"And Then There Were None\". Another popular writer during the Golden Age of detective fiction was Dorothy L. Sayers (1893–1957). Other recent noteworthy writers in this genre are Ruth Rendell, P. D. James and Scot Ian Rankin. Erskine Childers\\' \"The Riddle of the Sands\" (1903), is an early example of spy fiction. A noted writer in the spy novel genre was John le Carré, while in thriller writing, Ian Fleming created the character James Bond 007 in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye. Fleming chronicled Bond\\'s adventures in twelve novels, including \"Casino Royale\" (1953), \"Live and Let Die\" (1954), \"Dr. No\" (1958), \"Goldfinger\" (1959), \"Thunderball\" (1961), and nine short story works. Hungarian-born Emma Orczy\\'s (1865–1947) original play, \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\", opened in October 1903 at Nottingham\\'s Theatre Royal but was not a success. However, with a rewritten last act, it opened at the New Theatre in London in January 1905. The premier of the London production was enthusiastically received by the audience, running 122 performances and enjoying numerous revivals. \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" became a favourite of London audiences, playing more than 2,000 performances and becoming one of the most popular shows staged in England to that date. The novel \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" was published soon after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her \"reckless daredevil\" over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a musical and other media. John Buchan (1875–1940) published the adventure novel \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" in 1915. The novelist Georgette Heyer created the historical romance genre. The Kailyard school of Scottish writers, notably J. M. Barrie (1869–1937), creator of \"Peter Pan\" (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought of fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, Kenneth Grahame (1859–1932) wrote the children\\'s classic \"The Wind in the Willows\". An informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the \"Inklings\". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Lewis is especially known for \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", while Tolkien is best known as the author of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". Another significant writer is Alan Garner author of \"Elidor\" (1965), while Terry Pratchett is a more recent fantasy writer. Roald Dahl rose to prominence with his children\\'s fantasy novels, such as \"James and the Giant Peach\" and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", often inspired by experiences from his childhood, which are notable for their often unexpected endings, and J. K. Rowling author of the highly successful \"Harry Potter\" series and Philip Pullman famous for his \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy are other significant authors of fantasy novels for younger readers. Noted writers in the field of comic books are Neil Gaiman, and Alan Moore; Gaiman also produces graphic novels. In the later decades of the 20th century, the genre of science fiction began to be taken more seriously because of the work of writers such as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s (\"\"), Isaac Asimov, Ursula K. Le Guin, Robert Heinlein, Michael Moorcock and Kim Stanley Robinson. Another prominent writer in this genre, Douglas Adams, is particularly associated with the comic science fiction work, \"The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy\", which began life as a radio series in 1978. Mainstream novelists such as Doris Lessing and Margaret Atwood also wrote works in this genre, while Scottish novelist Ian M. Banks has also achieved a reputation as both a writer of traditional and science fiction novels.',\n",

This personal essay is a ruminative account of a wayfaring trip that began the year before when the author flew to Manila and met the star for the first time. It\\'s a pilgrimage of sorts, tracking the wandering icon in Manhattan, from her hotel bedroom to Times Square all the way to the airport. It crosses time and space from aquatic Bicol and Atlantic City to mystical Byzantine times and the tumultuous years of the Marcos dictatorship. It grapples with symbols and stories, the faith and powers at work in the act of devotion; how, collectively, the fans mirror a nation\\'s hopes for radical transformation, at home or elsewhere – a journey that ends with a stirring personal message from Nora Aunor.

       " \"Einstein's Sink is an antique sink that has been in use by the physics faculty of Leiden University since 1920. Originally the sink stood in the large lecture room of the old Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory. It was taken to the new building when the physicists moved to the Leiden Bioscience park in 1977. Here it still stands in the current large lecture room (The De Sitterzaal of the J.H. Oortgebouw), continuing the tradition of washing the hands of visiting famous scientists. A short list of 'sink users' consists out of Paul Ehrenfest, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Albert Einstein. But also more recently nobel prize winners like Brian Schmidt and Albert Fert. In 2015 plans were announced for a new science campus which will replace the current one in 2025. After some inquiries it was clear that the faculty board had no plans of moving the sink once more to the upcoming physics department and therefore a petition was started to 'save the sink'. Because of this the sink appeared in local and national media several times. The petition got 197 autographs within one month and was later presented to the faculty board. The science faculty accepted the petition and moved the sink to the De Sitter lecture room in the new Oort building, where it can keep serving the physicists like it did years before.\",\n",
       " \"The Harveian Society of London, named after the physician William Harvey, is a medical society and registered charity, founded in 1831. Doctors assemble regularly at the Medical Society of London, Chandos Street, Cavendish Square to converse and discuss medical matters through the medium of lectures and conferences. The society's council rotate annually and comprises the president, two vice-presidents, the treasurer, the executive and two honorary secretaries, the archivist and nine councillors. Origins. John Coakley Lettsom, had opened a dispensary in London in 1770, following which, in 1773, he founded the Medical Society of London. Over the next 50 years, the expansion of dispensaries, particularly around Marylebone, created a platform for a group of doctors to get together and create The West London Medical Society, the intention of which was to cultivate a medium to better their knowledge and advance medical science. By October 1831, the society's name had changed to 'The Harveian Society of London' and it had held its first meeting at the Western General Dispensary. From 1951, the meetings have been held at the Medical Society of London's home, Lettsom House. Anthony Todd Thompson and Marshall Hall, both physicians, were the first two presidents. Subsequently, presidents have frequently been high-profile medical professionals, including Thomas Hodgkin, D'Arcy Power, Lord Horder, Cecil Wakeley and Sir Zachary Cope. Society rules were first printed in 1832. The Society remained exclusively male until 1956, when women were permissible to join in only as guests, eventually being allowed full membership from 1964 under the Presidency of Dr. D. Geraint James. Annual Harveian lecture. Started in 1875, an annual lecture is given in honour of William Harvey. Past speakers have included surgeon (and brother of economist John Maynard Keynes) Geoffrey Keynes, nobel prize winners for work on penicillin Ernest Chain and Howard Florey, co-discoverer of DNA Francis Crick and heart transplant pioneer Christian Barnard.

In 1928, following the death of his son, killed in the first world war, Sir George Buckston Browne bestowed the 'Buckston Browne Prize' for a paper based on original work and 'medal' in memory of his son. Buckston Browne Gray Hill Dinner. Buckston Brown also endowed an annual dinner for Harveian members, which is also celebrated with the Buckston Browne cup. In 1944, Lt–Colonel Sir Norman Gray Hill was killed in the second world war. In honour of his endowment and memory, the annual dinner was renamed the Buckston Browne Gray Hill Dinner. Annual tribute. Every year, in June, the president and associates make a particular call to Harvey's birthplace in Folkestone and lay flowers at Harvey's statue. In 1973, in the presence of the society and on behalf of the British Medical Association, an honorary plaque was added. William Harvey Memorial Prize. Established in 1954, the William Harvey Memorial prize was initially open only to students from the William Harvey Grammar School. Harveian Library. A selection of Harvey's works, biographies and portraits are kept in a small library. Some portraits were removed from the Royal College of Physicians and returned to the society. Anniversaries.

Yu was born in the Liaoning Province, in northern China, in 1976. From 1996 to 2000 he completed his bachelor\\'s degree at the Lu Xun Fine Arts Academy, in Shenyang, around 250\\xa0km north of his hometown Xiuyan. In 2001, at the age of 25, he moved to Europe to study at the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Art under the German artist Jörg Immendorff. Fearing that the influence of the strong willed master would have suppressed his individual style and seeking for academic experience in more than only one establishment, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Art in Kassel in 2002. In 2006, he earned his master\\'s degree in painting at the Kunsthochschule Kassel, Germany, under Professor Jurgen Meyer. In 2013 he had his PhD from the School of Architecture of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing, China. He is now an associate professor at School of Architecture and Urban Planning of the Tongji University in Shanghai and works between there, Beijing and Bochum. His works have been exhibited in Europe, China and the US. Artistic work. When studying abroad in Germany, Yu has found a transparent chemical fabric, solid and with closely, woven meshes, which could be seen through from front to back. This kid of fabric, after slightly processing, can be a painting medium. Its transparency implicates the creation of a hybrid dimension that consists of both the virtual space created through the artist\\'s brush stokes and the physical space in front and behind the canvas. The painted net between the subject and the observer, the incisiveness of the chiaroscuro and the round thicker layers of colour tidily painted by the artist at regular distance collaborate to intensify this effect. The \"spatialisation\" and \"sensitisation\" of painting have already become a new trend of this era, and this group of transparent paintings by Yu just corresponds to this new indication, being of great inspiration for the development of painting methods. Thematically, one has the impression that the world, in which the subjects of Yu Xingze\\'s painting live, is a rather mysterious one. Gorillas, a gun, philanthropists, scientists, a nobel peace prize laureate, toys, heroes, flowers, stars: the effort of finding a logical contact point between them is regularly nullified by their variety. Once disproved a thematic rational categorisation, one can only let go and enter the evanescent world created by the artist to storage and process every piece of information he gathers. In this optic, the spatial dimension he creates with his sophisticated techniques only serves the purpose of housing this ephemeral mind constructs, clearly affirming their contingency thought daring stylistic choices.

       " 'The Vienna Ball of Sciences is a ball held annually in January in Vienna, Austria. It combines classic traditions with contemporary impulses from the field of science communication. Since its establishment in 2015, the Science Ball has quickly gained a reputation as one of the most successful and largest events in the Viennese ball season History. The establishment in 2015 goes back to an initiative of then-Mayor of Vienna, Michael Häupl, and the University Commissioner of the City of Vienna, Alexander Van der Bellen. It was their intention to position Vienna more clearly as a hotspot for science. At the request of Häupl, Van der Bellen and then-Science City Councilor Andreas Mailath-Pokorny, science manager and science communicator Oliver Lehmann started the development in the summer of 2014. The ball is organized by the association \"Wien Wissen\", of which Oliver Lehmann is chairman. The first Vienna Science Ball took place on January 31, 2015. Since its establishment, the science ball has traditionally been held on the last Saturday in January in the festive ballrooms of Vienna City Hall. Motto and programme. \"Decent fun – Dance with an attitude\" is the motto of the Vienna Science Ball. The ball program combines classic elements of a traditional dance ball with contemporary forms of representation and presentation from the fields of science and the arts. The protagonists hail from universities and research institutions in Vienna. Traditional components of a ball, such as the opening by the debutante committee, the Midnight Quadrille and table decorations, are expanded through scientific content. In 2018, a fashion show inspired by molecular biological experiments was held. In 2019, a thermal imaging camera visualized temperature profiles of guests in the ball disco. Honorary aegis and ball committee. Since the ball\\'s establishment, the rectors and presidents of all Viennese universities, private universities, educational colleges and universities of applied sciences have formed the honorary committee. Honorary aegis is granted by Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen, the chairmanship of the ball committee and the honorary presidium are held, as of 2019, by EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn, Mayor Michael Ludwig (until 2018 Mayor Michael Häupl), Science Minister Heinz Fassmann, city councilors Veronica Kaup-Hasler (until 2018 Andreas Mailath-Pokorny), and Maria Vassilakou. Ball ambassadors. One of the special features are the ball ambassadors: people from science with a marked interest in communicating it or from other areas of society such as politics, business, industry and the arts with a distinct (although often not publicly known) connection to science are chosen as ball ambassadors.

       " 'Alexander Veniaminovich Bari was a Russian and American engineer, entrepreneur and social activist, founder of the first Russian engineering company. Bari was a close friend of Vladimir Shukhov, Leo Tolstoy, Dmitri Mendeleev, Nikolay Zhukovsky, Fyodor Schechtel, Ivan Rerberg. Biography. Alexander Bari was born on in Saint Petersburg. He was the second son of a well-educated Baptized Jew . Veneamin Bari was a publicist, striving to educate Jews, he was favoured by Alexander von Humboldt, in whose honour the son was named. Veneamin Bari, who at that time was corresponding with Karl Marx, was forced to leave the Russian Empire and in 1862 emigrated to Swiss Zurich with his children and wife Henriette Sergeevna. In 1865 the family moved to the US, but Alexander stayed in Zurich and graduated from a gymnasium in 1867. In 1870 he graduated from ETH Zurich with a degree in engineering. During his university years, he met , who later recalled Bari as a leader of a student fellowship, who introduced him to the ETH and the city life. He particularly remembered how Bari acquainted a young man in a café, who turned out to be a son of a factory owner, and on the next day they were invited to have a tour around the father\\'s factory. After graduation, Alexander Bari decided to reconcile with his family and went to the USA. As he had no means to purchase a ticket, he took the job as an assistant engineer on the steamer. In the USA Bari received citizenship and started working as an assistant engineer at a machine and bridge-building plant in Detroit, later he was hired as an engineer at an industrial company in Philadelphia. Soon he won a competition to build pavilions for the Centennial Exposition and received the gold medal. A Russian delegation visited the Exhibition, Bari acquainted several professors and students of the (RITS), such as , Pavel Panayev, , Vladimir Shukhov, . Bari helped the Russians a purchase of laboratory equipment, tools, and instruments. In gratitude he was elected as a corresponding member of the RITS in 1877. In Philadelphia, he met Eda von Grunberg (Zinaida Jakovlevna in Russian), his future wife. She was from a German family that moved to Russia in the times of Catherine the Great. Eda came to Philadelphia with her elder sister, who married Alexander\\'s older brother. Eda wanted to go back to Russia, in Summer 1877 the couple with their daughter Anna came to St Petersburg. Alexander and his younger brother William, a SPMU graduate, co-founded a small enterprise to construct and produce electric motors. However, the production found no demand in Russia. Soon Bari acquainted N. A. Sytenko, a retired engineer colonel and a member of the . Together they launched \\'Bari, Sytenko and Co\\' and entered the construction business in the Russian petroleum industry. Soon Bari and his family moved to Moscow. Kuskovo Plant. The development and implementation of all \\'Bari, Sytenko and Co\\' projects were managed by Ludvig Nobel. The company engaged in oil production in Grozny and Baku. The promising young engineer Vladimir Shukhov was invited to work by Bari. The highly successful project resulted in the establishment of the Branobel that soon became one of the leading oil companies in Russia and Europe. The first 10\\xa0km long oil pipeline on the Absheron Peninsula was opened in Autumn 1878, it started at Balaxanı and ended in the Black City. The pipe\\'s diameter was 0,76 m. In 1879 the second Russian oil pipeline was opened by \\'G. M. Lianozov and Co\\'. On September 13, 1880, Sytenko, Bari, and the titular councillor N. Rubinsky sent to the office of Moscow Governor-General a request for construction of an oil plant in the capital. The document was signed on November 19, soon followed by the establishment of the Russian-American Oil Partnership with a capital stock of 375,000 roubles. The enterprise processed oil from Baku in the . The plant was constructed by Vladimir Shukhov, it had eight oil stills and produced Kerosene, Astroline, lubricants, and brea. The refinery became operational on June 8, 1881. The witness recalled that At the All-Russia Exhibition of 1882 in Moscow, Kuskovo Refinery was awarded with a bronze prize for high quality oil production. In June 1882 the company hired young Dmitri Mendeleev as a chemistry and production consultant. Soon it launched a continuous crude distillation. In the same year Bari sold his share to and started his own business. A. V. Bari Construction Company. In 1880 Alexander Bari founded the \\'A. V. Bari Technical Company\\' and invited Vladimir Shukhov as a chief engineer. Later the company was renamed into \\'A. V. Bari Construction Company\\'. It offered various services from design to construction and soon gained wide recognition both in the Russian Empire and abroad. In a few years, the company produced a special steam boiler, designed by Vladimir Shukhov. To mass-produce the invention, Bari built the in Tyufeleva Roscha of the Danilovsky District. It became operational in February 1884. In five years since its foundation \\'Bari Technical Company\\' assets included the boiler plant in Moscow and several branch offices in Saint Petersburg, Kharkiv, Nizhny Novgorod, and Yekaterinburg. Bari introduced a whole new working environment: he paid salaries 10% higher than average on the market, working hours were shorter, the employees received hot meals at an employer\\'s expense. Bari also offered a kind of medical leave — in case of sickness a worker was paid full salary for the first week and 50% for the second. The company produced steel oil storage tanks, in 30 years it manufactured 3240 units. From 1885 the enterprise participated in the creation of the oil cargo fleet. The tankers were built at Saratov and Volgograd shipyards. Shipowners Baranov and Shitov ordered two steel oil lighters with 40 and 50 thousand poods capacity. The \\'A. V. Bari Technical Company\\' also constructed other objects, such as oil pipelines, grain elevators, bridges, Hyperboloid towers, etc. Since 1892 the company actively participated in the development of the Russian Railways. It displayed several pavilions at the All-Russia Exhibition of 1896 in Nizhny Novgorod. The \\'A. V. Bari Technical Company\\' took part in the reconstruction of the and the building of the Metrowagonmash. Personal life. Alexander Bari was a friend of many brightest people of his time — Dmitri Mendeleev, Nikolay Zhukovsky, Sergey Chaplygin, Fyodor Schechtel, Ivan Rerberg, and others were frequent guests in his house. Since 1884 Bari lived at , 24, later he moved to the house №22. In 1898 Bari first met Leo Tolstoy. With daughter Anna Alexandrovna he paid visits to the writer\\'s house in Khamovniki. When Russia faced difficult times, Bari told his wife that \"its better to be a busman in Zurich than a millionaire in Russia\" and asked her to leave the country. In September 1905 he wrote \"Things get worse in the country and we only have to endure…\" After the assassination of Pyotr Stolypin Bari wrote to his friends that \\'the situation is dreadful and the worst is coming\\'. Despite all efforts, the company faced distress. The workers at factories talked Bari\\'s employees into going on strikes and joining the revolutionary movement. This significantly affected the business. In 1909 Alexander Bari retired and entrusted the company to son Victor. Alexander Bari passed away on and was interred in Vvedenskoye Cemetery. The widow Zinaida Bari inherited the business, her brother Vladimir managed her assets. The obituary in the newspaper \"\" noted that: In April 1918, \"Izvestia\" published an article exposing the counter-revolutionary conspiracy headed by Vladimir Bari, he was arrested and interrogated by Felix Dzerzhinsky. Vladimir Bari was released on the intervention of the American consul and soon emigrated. Shortly afterwards, Victor Bari and all his family left the country. Olga Bari (1879–1954), one of Alexander Bari\\'s daughters, became an artist and was one of the Mir iskusstva members. She lived in the USSR for all her life and scarcely exhibited.',\n",
       " \"Stefano Fantoni (born 4 June 1945) is an Italian theoretical physicist, now retired from the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste (SISSA), still working in the fields of nuclear physics and low temperature physics. The common denominator of his research was to go beyond the mean-field models in solving the so-called many-body theory that occurs in quantum Bose or/and Fermi systems, characterized by the presence of strong correlations among their components. In the seventies he has been the author, together with Sergio Rosati, of the Power Series cluster theory for strongly interacting fermions, known as FR cluster expansion, and later, of the Fermion Hyper Netted Chain (FHNC) integral equations to compute the FR expansion terms at all orders. Such theories have opened up the modern many-body studies on strongly interacting Fermi systems, such as nuclear matter and Quantum fluids. It is due to him and to V. R. Pandharipande and O. Benhar, the extension at all perturbative orders of the so called Correlated Basis Function (CBF) theory, originally developed by E. Feenberg, and the proof of its renormalizability, as well as the first realistic calculation of the one-body Green's Function and the Response functions of Nuclear matter, largely used to explain the experimental results of electron and neutrino scattering on heavy nuclei. Also of great importance are his studies done together with Kevin Schmidt on Quantum Monte Carlo methods for nuclear systems, and particularly the development of the Auxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC) method, heavily used in nuclear and neutron matter calculations. Biography. Stefano Fantoni was born in Taranto on 4 June 1945. He attended the high school in Livorno, graduated in Physics in 1968 from University of Pisa, and received his PhD degree in 1970 from the Scuola Normale Superiore. He first worked as an assistant lecturer at the University of Pisa from November 1970 and then as Associate Professor since 1972. In 1986 he became full professor and three-month later he was given the chair of Nuclear Physics at the University of Lecce. From 1991 to 2000 he acted as Director of the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of the International School for Advanced Studies, SISSA in Trieste. In 2004 he was elected and nominated as SISSA Director, duty that he has covered until November 2010. Stefano Fantoni married in 1969 and has two children and two grandchildren. Research activity. Fantoni's research activity has been mainly devoted to quantum liquids of interest of nuclear and condensed matter phenomena typical of low temperature physics. He started doing research during his graduation thesis in light nuclei with his first article in 1970 on 6Li. He is today among the three topmost scientists of Italian nationality in the field of theoretical Nuclear physics. The common denominator of his research was to go beyond the mean-field models in solving the so-called many-body theory that occurs in quantum Bose or/and Fermi systems, characterized by the presence of strong correlations among their components. In this context he gave four main contributions: the development cluster expansion techniques, known in the literature as the Fantoni-Rosati (FR) cluster expansion, (ii) the derivation of the Fermi Hyper Netted Chain (FHNC) equations, to sum up series of cluster terms (iii) the development of Correlated Basis Function theory (CBF) and, more recently, (iv) the development of a new numerical simulation Monte Carlo method for nuclear systems, known as Auxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC). Fantoni founded four research groups one in Pisa, a second one in Lecce and a third one in Urbana, Illinois, all in the field of nuclear physics and a fourth one in Trieste in Condensed matter physics. He also coordinated a research group made of few Italian and foreign universities and research laboratories in the field of nuclear astrophysics. He has been the Italian representative of nuclear physics in several international bodies dealing with future perspectives in nuclear physics and electron scattering off nuclei at intermediate energies. His research group at the SISSA Interdisciplinary Laboratory has developed a new communication model based on the existing interconnections and inter-relations amongst communicating agents. The SISSA model has been designed to overcome some of the deficiencies of the traditional top-down model in which communication simply flows from those who know to those who do not know. In connections with this kind of research Stefano Fantoni founded in 2005 the first PhD school in Science and Society supported by both SISSA and the University of Milan. Fantoni has been co-editor of the series Tessere (Cuen editing company, Naples) (1994–1998); publisher of the e-journal JCOM from its foundation in 2004 and author of various articles in newspapers and books and of a dozen research articles on science communication. International experience. Stefano Fantoni spent several stays abroad as visiting professor: in 1977 at the Niels Bohr Institute of Copenhagen in 1979 at the Institute fur Physik in Koln; from 1980 to 1982 and in 1984 at the Department of Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1990 at the Jefferson Laboratory (CEBAF) in Newport News, Virginia, r; in 2000 at the Theory Center Seattle (Washington). He has also been a consultant of the National Science Foundation and of the European Commission in the framework of INTAS program; italian delegate to the OECD Committee Megaforum Science in Nuclear Physics in 1997 and 1998; member of the Program Advisory Committee for the Jefferson Laboratory at Newport News in Virginia from 1989 to 1993, when the accelerator was still under construction and the center began to outline its strategic lines of experimental research; member and then chairman of the Program Advisory Committee of INFN laboratories in Legnaro (Padova) in the period 1991–1996; member of the board of directors of the European Center for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and related areas (ECT*) in 1993, when it was founded in Villazzano (Trento), until 1995; during the period 2003/2009 he was member of the International Advisory Committee of the Institute for Advanced Studies, Collegium Budapest. Evaluation and management experience. Stefano Fantoni was the founder of the Elba International Physics Center (EIPC) which he directed from 1985 to 1992. During this period EIPC acted as the Italian counterpart of the Aspen Center for Physics in Colorado, organizing conferences and workshops funded by local administration and some international research centers. In the period 1992–1993 Stefano Fantoni took part, as italian member, together with the Danish nobelist Ben Mottelson and the french scientist Oriol Bohigas, in the Committee nominated to establish the European Centre for Theoretical Physics, ECT*. The center is still in operation in the fields of nuclear physics, astrophysics and condensed matter. From 1991 to 2000 he directed the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of SISSA, a laboratory having the mission of developing and promoting new research areas. He founded the Neuroscience sector. In 1994 he founded the School in Science Communication which he directed until 2004. He was also President of FEST, the Trieste Festival of Scientific books and journals in the years 2007 and 2008. Stefano Fantoni has been the Director of SISSA from 2004 to 2010 and member of CRUI, the association of the Rectors of the Italian universities, in the same period. His period as director has been characterized by the design and construction of the new SISSA location, a building of almost 25000mq, 150000mq able to host the whole educational and research activity of SISSA. He has been nominated as the president of the International Foundation for the Development of Freedom of Science (FIT) in Trieste in 2008. In the same year he was nominated from the regional administration of Friuli Venezia Giulia as delegate to the commission Coordination of universities and research institutions of the Friuli Venezia Giulia. He has also been nominated as the president of the Trieste section of Alliance Francaise in 2009. Fantoni was a member of the national committee for the evaluation of the basic research projects (FIRB committee) from 2007 to 2010 and member of the national committee to evaluate scientific museums and projects on popularization of science from 1995 to 1997 and from 2009 to 2010. He has been the first President of ANVUR (the Italian Agency for the evaluation of the university and of the research) (2011–2016). He has been the Champion of EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF), in occasion of the nomination of Trieste as European City of Science for the year 2020. He is at present on the board of the EuroScience committee. Prizes and awards. For his contributions to theoretical nuclear physics and for the development of FHNC theory he has awarded the prestigious international recognition Eugene Feenberg Memorial Medal 2007. For his work in science communication, he received the 2001 Kalinga Prize, awarded by UNESCO. He also received the Award Piazzano in 2002, to have founded and directed the Master in Science communication; in 2006, the Pirelli Internet-ional prize for the multimedia initiative Ulysses in the net of science; in 2007, the Capo d'Orlando prize for his activities in science communication. \",\n",
       " 'The 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature was the fourth literary prize resulting from Alfred Nobel\\'s will. It was equally divided between the French Provençal philologist Frédéric Mistral (1830–1914) \"in recognition of the fresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production, which faithfully reflects the natural scenery and native spirit of his people, and, in addition, his significant work as a Provençal philologist\" and the Spanish engineer and dramatist José Echegaray Eizaguirre (1832–1916) \"in recognition of the numerous and brilliant compositions which, in an individual and original manner, have revived the great traditions of the Spanish drama.\" The winners were announced in October 1904 by Carl David af Wirsén, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy. It was the first of the four occasions (1917, 1966, and 1974) when the Nobel Prize in Literature has been shared between two individuals. Laureates. Frédéric Mistral. Mistral\\'s passion for poetry was sparked by one of his teachers, the Provençal poet Joseph Roumanille. He spent many years compiling \"Trésor dóu Félibrige\", a dictionary of the Provençal language published by the Felibrige literary society, which he founded himself. His most important work, \"Mirèio\", was published in 1859, the result of eight years of work. He also authored \"Lou Tresor dóu Félibrige\" (1878–1886), which to date remains the most comprehensive dictionary of the Occitan language, and one of the most reliable, thanks to the precision of its definitions. It is a bilingual dictionary, Occitan-French, in two large volumes, with all of the dialects of \"oc\", including Provençal. Mistral owes to François Vidal the work of typesetting and revising that dictionary. José Echegaray Eizaguirre. Echegaray\\'s literary debut took place relatively late, in 1874 when he was 42 years old. He subsequently had a productive career, publishing an average of two plays a year for the rest of his life. A mathematician, engineer and administrator, he built his plays with the same regard for exactitude and duty that inspired his public life. Conflicts involving duty are at the heart of most of his plays, and he upheld the idea with uncompromising severity. His exalted romanticism is apparent in his choice of subjects. His most famous plays include \"El gran Galeoto\" (adapted into a silent film entitled \"The World and His Wife\"), \"La esposa del vengador\" (\"The Avenger\\'s Wife\", 1874), and \"Conflicto entre dos deberes\" (\"Conflict of Two Duties\", 1882). He also extensively wrote 25 to 30 mathematical physics volumes. Deliberations. Nominations. For the 1904 prize, the Swedish Academy received 29 nominations for 21 individuals. Among the nominees were Albert Sorel, Anatole France (awarded later in 1921), Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Rudyard Kipling (awarded in 1907), and Henryk Sienkiewicz (awarded later in 1905). Two of the nominees were women, Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf (awarded later in 1909) and French actress Émilie Lerou. The authors Edwin Arnold, Anton Chekhov, Kate Chopin, Karl Emil Franzos, Lafcadio Hearn, Theodor Herzl, Wilhelm Jordan, Mór Jókai, Antonio Labriola, Dumitru Theodor Neculuță, Auguste Molinier, Larin Paraske, Ștefan Petică, Abai Qunanbaiuly, Samuel Smiles, Leslie Stephen, Hans von Hopfen, and Jose Clemente Zulueta died in 1904 without having been nominated for the prize. Prize decision. It was later revealed that the Swedish Academy\\'s official justification for a shared prize is not supported by how the Academy actually made their decision. The shared prize was in fact a compromise solution, caused by certain incompetence by the Nobel committee during the process. The shortlist consisted of Henryk Sienkiewicz, Frédéric Mistral and José Echegaray. During the committee\\'s deliberations, Sienkiewicz\\'s \"Quo Vadis\" was hailed as a masterpiece, but was passed over to the following year. Mistral, being shortlisted, appealed the committee because of his Provençal dialect, but the committee chairman Carl David af Wirsén was uncertain about the poor quality of translations of Mistral\\'s works by committee member Rupert Nyblom, especially on his masterpiece \"Mirèio\". Carl David af Wirsén was worried about the reputation of the committee and proposed withdrawing Mistral\\'s candidacy and opting for Echegaray instead. After failing to get major approval and only find fifty per cent support for this proposal, the committee decided to share the prize, as a compromise choice, between the two men. Reactions. There was an uproar in the press in Spain and Italy, as Spain thought Benito Pérez Galdós – one of Europe\\'s greatest living novelists at the time – would get the prize, same as Italians felt when they found that their national poet Giosuè Carducci was not recognized. Award Ceremony. At the award ceremony in December 10, 1904, af Wirsén said: Echegaray was not able to partake in nobel banquet and the awarding ceremony in Stockholm due to health conditions.',\n",
       " 'Esperanto in Japan(日本のエスペラント) dates back to the 19th century. History. Esperantists briefly increased in Japan in the 1880s, along with the interest in the planned language Volapük, but most scholars think it was 1906 that the Japanese esperanto movement really started, which was during the Russo Japanese war. One of the early learners of esperanto was Japanese novelist Futabatei Shimei.Kuroita Katsumi, and Osugi Sakae(anarchist).An influential student group known as the (新人会). hosted debates with fellow Korean and Chinese students in esperanto, and the Bahai mission headed by Vasili Eroshenko and Agnes Baldwin Alexander, was influential in spreading Esperanto along with Christian missions.Esperanto chants were shouted during the visit of Indian nobel prize winner Rabindranath Tagore to Japan. Japan had its second boom in Esperanto from the 1920s to 1940s, with every esperanto speaker in Japan beginning to publish their own esperanto material. Esperanto was used by both leftwing and right wing movements, but the leftwing faced a significant decline in the 1930s. The was founded in 1919.']"
